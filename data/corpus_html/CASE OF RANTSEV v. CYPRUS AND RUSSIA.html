On the same date M.A. informed the Immigration Office in Limassol that Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva had abandoned her place of work and residence. According to M.A.’s subsequent witness statement, he wanted Ms Rantseva to be arrested and expelled from Cyprus so that he could bring another girl to work in the cabaret.

Upon being advised by the cabaret artiste that Ms Rantseva was in the discotheque, M.A. called the police and asked them to arrest her. He then went to the discotheque together with a security guard from his cabaret. An employee of the discotheque brought Ms Rantseva to him. In his subsequent witness statement, M.A. said (translation):</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“When [Ms Rantseva] got in to my car, she did not complain at all or do anything else.

He made a brief statement in which he set out the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s arrival in Cyprus, her employment and her subsequent disappearance from the apartment on 19 March 2001. According to the statement of the police officer in charge when they arrived (translation):</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">“On 28 March 2001, slightly before 4a.m., [M.A.] found [Ms Rantseva] in the nightclub Titanic ... he took her and led her to the police station stating that Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva was illegal and that we should place her in the cells.

After investigating, he advised them that her name was not in the database of wanted persons. He further advised that there was no record of M.A.’s complaint of 19 March 2001 and that, in any case, a person did not become illegal until 15 days after a complaint was made. The passport officer contacted the person in charge of the AIS (Police Aliens and Immigration Service), who gave instructions that Ms Rantseva was not to be detained and that her employer, who was responsible for her, was to pick her up and take her to their Limassol Office for further investigation at 7 a.m. that day. The police officers contacted M.A. to ask him to collect Ms Rantseva. M.A. was upset that the police would not detain her and refused to come and collect her. The police officers told him that their instructions were that if he did not take her they were to allow her to leave. M.A. became angry and asked to speak to their superior. The police officers provided a telephone number to M.A. The officers were subsequently advised by their superior that M.A. would come and collect Ms Rantseva. Both officers, in their witness statements, said that Ms Rantseva did not appear drunk. The officer in charge said (translation):</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“Ms Rantseva remained with us ... She was applying her make-up and did not look drunk ...

He then took Ms Rantseva to the apartment of M.P., a male employee at his cabaret. The apartment M.P. lived in with his wife, D.P., was a split-level apartment with the entrance located on the fifth floor of a block of flats. According to M.A., they placed Ms Rantseva in a room on the second floor of the apartment. In his police statement, he said:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“She just looked drunk and did not seem to have any intention to do anything.

Upon his arrival there he was informed that the girl they had been looking for, of Russian origin, was in the discotheque. Then M.A. arrived, accompanied by a security guard from the cabaret, and asked the employees of “Titanic” to bring the girl to the entrance. M.A., Ms Rantseva and the security guard then all got into M.A.’s car and left. At around 4.30 a.m. M.P. returned to his house and went to sleep. At around 6 a.m. his wife woke him up and informed him that M.A. had arrived together with Ms Rantseva and that they would stay until the Immigration Office opened. He then fell asleep.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">24.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">D.P. stated that M.A. brought Ms Rantseva to the apartment at around 5.45 a.m..

D.P. stated that Ms Rantseva looked drunk and did not want to drink or eat anything. According to D.P., she and her husband went to sleep at around 6 a.m. while M.A. stayed in the living room. Having made her statement, D.P. revised her initial description of events, now asserting that her husband had been asleep when M.A. arrived at their apartment with Ms Rantseva. She stated that she had been scared to admit that she had opened the door of the apartment on her own and had had coffee with M.A..</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">25.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">At around 6.30 a.m. on 28 March 2001, Ms Rantseva was found dead on the street below the apartment.

She looked for her all over the apartment and then noticed that the balcony door in the bedroom was open. She went out onto the balcony and saw the bedspread and realised what Ms Rantseva had done. She went onto another balcony and saw a body lying on the street, covered by a white sheet and surrounded by police officers.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">28.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">M.P. stated that he was woken up by noise at around 7 a.m. and saw his wife in a state of shock; she told him that Ms Rantseva had fallen from the balcony.

Her report explained that since the mid-1970s, thousands of young women had legally entered Cyprus to work as artistes but had in fact worked as prostitutes in one of the many cabarets in Cyprus. Since the beginning of the 1980s, efforts had been made by the authorities to introduce a stricter regime in order to guarantee effective immigration monitoring and to limit the “well-known and commonly acknowledged phenomenon of women who arrived in Cyprus to work as artistes”. However, a number of the measures proposed had not been implemented due to objections from cabaret managers and artistic agents.</span></p><p class="s6477A72F"><span class="sBB9EE52A">84.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Ombudsman’s report noted that in the 1990s, the prostitution market in Cyprus started to be served by women coming mainly from former States of the Soviet Union. She concluded that:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“During the same period, one could observe a certain improvement regarding the implementation of those measures and the policy being adopted. However, there was not improvement regarding sexual exploitation, trafficking and mobility of women under a regime of modern slavery.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">85.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the living and working conditions of artistes, the report stated:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“The majority of the women entering the country to work as artistes come from poor families of the post socialist countries. Most of them are educated ... Few are the real artistes. Usually they are aware that they will be compelled to prostitute themselves. However, they do not always know about the working conditions under which they will exercise this job. There are also cases of alien women who come to Cyprus, having the impression that they will work as waitresses or dancers and that they will only have drinks with clients (‘consomation’). They are made by force and threats to comply with the real terms of their work ...</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Alien women who do not succumb to this pressure are forced by their employers to appear at the District Aliens and Immigration Branch to declare their wish to terminate their contract and to leave Cyprus on ostensible grounds ... Consequently, the employers can replace them quickly with other artistes ...</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The alien artistes from the moment of their entry into the Republic of Cyprus to their departure are under constant surveillance and guard of their employers. After finishing their work, they are not allowed to go wherever they want. There are serious complaints even about cases of artistes who remain locked in their residence place. Moreover, their passports and other personal documents are retained by their employers or artistic agents. Those who refuse to obey are punished by means of violence or by being imposed fees which usually consist in deducting percentages of drinks, ‘consommation’ or commercial sex. Of course these amounts are included in the contracts signed by the artistes.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">...</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Generally, artistes stay at one or zero star hotels, flats or guest-houses situated near or above the cabarets, whose owners are the artistic agents or the cabaret owners. These places are constantly guarded. Three or four women sleep in each room. According to reports given by the Police, many of these buildings are inappropriate and lack sufficient sanitation facilities.</span></p><p class="sFD4D42B6"><span class="sBB9EE52A">...Finally, it is noted that at the point of their arrival in Cyprus alien artistes are charged with debts, for instance with traveling expenses, commissions deducted by the artistic agent who brought them in Cyprus or with commissions deducted by the agent who located them in their country etc. Therefore, they are obliged to work under whichever conditions to pay off at least their debts.” (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">footnotes omitted)</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">86.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Concerning the recruitment of women in their countries of origin, the report noted:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“Locating women who come to work in Cyprus is usually undertaken by local artistic agents in cooperation with their homologues in different countries and arrangements are made between both of them. After having worked for six months maximum in Cyprus, a number of these artistes are sent to Lebanon, Syria, Greece or Germany.” (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">footnotes omitted)</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">87.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Ombudsman observed that the police received few complaints from trafficking victims:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“The police explain that the small number of complaints filed is due to the fear that artistes feel, since they receive threats against their lives on the part of their procurer.”</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">88.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">She further noted that protection measures for victims who had filed complaints were insufficient. Although they were permitted to work elsewhere, they were required to continue working in similar employment. They could therefore be easily located by their former employers.</span></p><p class="s6477A72F"><span class="sBB9EE52A">89.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Ombudsman concluded:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“The phenomenon of trafficking in person has so tremendously grown worldwide.

The report noted, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">inter alia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, that:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“29. It is not at all difficult to understand how Cyprus, given its remarkable economic and tourist development, has come to be a major destination for this traffic in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The absence of an immigration policy and the legislative shortcomings in that respect have merely encouraged the phenomenon.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">92.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the legal framework in place in Cyprus (see paragraphs 127 to 131 below), the Commissioner observed:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“30. The authorities have responded at the normative level. The Act of 2000 (number 3(I), 2000) has established a suitable framework for suppression of trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children. Under the Act, any action identifiable as trafficking in human beings in the light of the Convention for the Suppression of Trafficking in Persons and of the Exploitation and Prostitution of Others, together with other acts of a similar nature specified by law, are an offence punishable by 10 years’ imprisonment, the penalty being increased to 15 years where the victim is under 18 years of age. The offence of sexual exploitation carries a 15</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">year prison sentence. If committed by persons in the victim’s entourage or persons wielding authority or influence over the victim, the penalty is 20 years in prison. According to the provisions of Article 4, using children for the production and sale of pornographic material is an offence. Article 7 grants State aid, within reasonable limits, to victims of exploitation; such aid comprises subsistence allowance, temporary accommodation, medical care and psychiatric support. Article 8 reaffirms the right to redress by stressing the power of the court to award punitive damages justified by the degree of exploitation or the degree of the accused person’s constraint over the victim. A foreign worker lawfully present in Cyprus who is a victim of exploitation can approach the authorities to find other employment up until the expiry of the initial work permit (Article 9). Lastly, the Council of Ministers, under Article 10, appoints a guardian for victims with the principal duties of counselling and assisting them, examining complaints of exploitation, and having the culprits prosecuted, as well as for pinpointing any deficiency or loophole in the law and for making recommendations with a view to their removal.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">93.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Concerning practical measures, the Commissioner noted:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“31. At a practical level, the Government has made efforts to protect women who have laid a complaint against their employers by permitting them to remain in the country in order to substantiate the charges. In certain cases, the women have remained in Cyprus at government expense during the investigation.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">94.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, he criticised the failure of the authorities to tackle the problem of the excessive number of young foreign women coming to work in Cypriot cabarets:</span></p><p class="sB1BD30C0"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“32. However, apart from punitive procedures, preventive control measures could be introduced. By the authorities’ own admission, the number of young women migrating to Cyprus as nightclub artistes is well out of proportion to the population of the island.”</span></p><p class="s804EF768"><span class="s29100277">C.</span><span class="s9C864DC2">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Extracts of follow-up report of 26 March 2006 by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights on the progress made in implementing his recommendations (CommDH(2006)12)</span></p><p class="s507703F"><span class="sBB9EE52A">95.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 26 March 2006, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights published a follow-up report in which he assessed the progress of the Cypriot Government in implementing the recommendations of his previous report.

The Commissioner noted in his 2003 report that the number of young women migrating to Cyprus as nightclub artistes was well out of proportion to the population of the island, and that the authorities should consider introducing preventive control measures to deal with this phenomenon, in conjunction with legislative safeguards. In particular, the Commissioner recommended that the authorities adopt and implement a plan of action against trafficking in human beings.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">96.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The report continued:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“49. The so called ‘cabaret artiste’ visas are in fact permits to enter and work in nightclubs and bars. These permits are valid for 3 months and can be extended for a further 3 months. The permit is applied for by the establishment owner on behalf of the woman in question. Approximately 4,000 permits are issued each year, with 1,200 women working at a given time and most women originating from Eastern Europe. A special information leaflet has been prepared by the Migration Service and translated into four languages. The leaflet is given to women entering the country on such permits, is also available on the website of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and copies of the leaflet are sent to the consulates in Russia, Bulgaria, the Ukraine and Romania in order for women to be informed before they enter Cyprus. The leaflet sets out the rights of the women and the responsibilities of their employers. The authorities are aware that many of the women who enter Cyprus on these artistes visas will in fact work in prostitution.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">97.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Commissioner’s report highlighted recent and pending developments in Cyprus:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“50. A new Law on Trafficking in Human Beings is currently being discussed. The new law will include other forms of exploitation such as labour trafficking as well as trafficking for sexual exploitation. Cyprus has signed but not ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">51. The Attorney General’s Office has prepared a National Action Plan for the Combating of Human Trafficking. The Action Plan was presented and approved by the Council of Ministers in April 2005. Some NGOs complained of their lack of involvement in the consultation process. The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the implementation of the Action Plan. According to the Action Plan, women involved in cases of sexual exploitation or procuring are not arrested or charged with any offence, but are considered as victims and are under the care of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Victims who will act as witnesses in court trials can reside in Cyprus until the end of the case. They have the possibility of working, or if they do not wish to work, the Ministry will cover all their residential, health and other needs. A special procedures manual has been drafted for the treatment of victims of trafficking, and has been circulated to all ministries and government departments, as well as NGOs for consultation.</span></p><p class="sFD4D42B6"><span class="sBB9EE52A">52. There is no specific shelter for victims of trafficking at present, although victims may be accommodated by the authorities in two rooms in state-owned retirement homes, which are available in each major town. A shelter in Limassol is due to be opened soon, which will provide accommodation for 15 women, as well as providing the services of a social worker, lawyer, and vocational advisor.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">98.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards steps taken to improve information collection and research into trafficking, he noted:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“53. An Office for the Prevention and Combating of Human Trafficking was set up by the police in April 2004. The office’s role is to collect and evaluate intelligence regarding trafficking in human beings, to co-ordinate operations of all police divisions and departments, to organise and participate in operations, and to follow-up on cases that are under investigation, pending trial or presented to the courts. The office also prepares reports on trafficking and investigates child pornography on the Internet. In addition, the office organises educational seminars carried out at the Cyprus Police Academy.</span></p><p class="sFD4D42B6"><span class="sBB9EE52A">54. According to statistical information provided by the police from 2000 to 2005, there is a clear increase in the number of cases reported concerning offences of sexual exploitation, procuring, and living on the earnings of prostitution, etc. NGOs confirm that awareness about issues relating to trafficking has increased.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">99.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Finally, in respect of preventative measures, the Commissioner highlighted recent positive developments:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“55. Preventive and suppressive measures are also undertaken by the police, such as raids in cabarets, inspections, interviews with women, co-operation with mass media, and control of advertisements found in different newspapers. The police provide an anonymous toll-free hotline where anybody can call to seek help or give information. Cabarets which are under investigation are put on a black list and are unable to apply for new visas.</span></p><p class="sFD4D42B6"><span class="sBB9EE52A">56. Some efforts have been made by the Cypriot authorities to improve victim identification and referral, and in particular, 150 police officers have been trained on this issue. However, according to NGOs a culture still prevails in which women are seen by the police to have ‘consented’ to their predicament and victim identification remains inadequate.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">100.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The report reached the following conclusions:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“57. Trafficking in human beings is one of the most pressing and complex Human Rights issues faced by Council of Europe member states, including Cyprus. There is obviously a risk that the young women who enter Cyprus on artiste visas may be victims of trafficking in human beings or later become victims of abuse or coercion. These women are officially recruited as cabaret dancers but are nevertheless often expected also to work as prostitutes. They are usually from countries with inferior income levels to those in Cyprus and may find themselves in a vulnerable position to refuse demands from their employers or clients. The system itself, whereby the establishment owner applies for the permit on behalf of the woman, often renders the woman dependent on her employer or agent, and increases the risk of her falling into the hands of trafficking networks.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">58. The Commissioner urges the Cypriot authorities to be especially vigilant about monitoring the situation and ensuring that the system of artiste visas is not used for facilitating trafficking or forced prostitution. In this context, the Commissioner recalls the exemplary reaction of the Luxembourg authorities to similar concerns expressed in his report on the country and their withdrawal of the cabaret artiste visa regime. Changes to the current practice might, at the very least, include women having to apply for the visa themselves, and the information leaflet being given to the women, if possible, before they enter the country.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">59. The Commissioner welcomes the new National Action Plan for the Combating of Human Trafficking as a first step in addressing this issue and encourages the Ministry of the Interior to ensure its full implementation. The new law on trafficking, once enacted, will also play an important role. The variety of police activities in response to this phenomenon, such as the setting up of the Office for the Prevention and Combating of Human Trafficking, should also be welcomed.</span></p><p class="s8A9F351B"><span class="sBB9EE52A">60. In order to respect the human rights of trafficked persons, the authorities need to be able to identify victims and refer them to specialised agencies which can offer shelter and protection, as well as support services. The Commissioner urges the Cypriot authorities to continue with the training of police officers in victim identification and referral, and encourages the authorities to include women police officers in this area. More effective partnerships with NGOs and other civil society actors should also be developed. The Commissioner expresses his hope that the shelter in Limassol will be put into operation as soon as possible.”</span></p><p class="s804EF768"><span class="s29100277">D.</span><span class="s9C864DC2">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Extracts of report of 12 December 2008 by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights on his visit to Cyprus on 7</span><span class="s29100277">‑</span><span class="s29100277">10</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">July 2008 (CommDH(2008)36)</span></p><p class="s507703F"><span class="sBB9EE52A">101.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Commissioner of Human Rights has recently published a further report following a visit to Cyprus in July 2008. The report comments on the developments in respect of issues relating to trafficking of human beings, emphasising at the outset that trafficking of women for exploitation was a major problem in many European countries, including Cyprus. The report continued as follows:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“33. Already in 2003, the Commissioner for Administration (Ombudswoman) stated that Cyprus had been associated with trafficking both as a country of destination and transit, the majority of women being blackmailed and forced to provide sexual services. In 2008, the island still is a destination country for a large number of women trafficked from the Philippines, Russia, Moldova, Hungary, Ukraine, Greece, Vietnam, Uzbekistan and the Dominican Republic for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation ... Women are reportedly denied part or all of their salaries, forced to surrender their passports, and pressed into providing sexual services for clients. Most of these women are unable to move freely, are forced to work far above normal working hours, and live in desperate conditions, isolated and under strict surveillance.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">34. Victims of trafficking are recruited to Cyprus mainly on three-month so-called ‘artiste’ or ‘entertainment’ visas to work in the cabaret industry including night clubs and bars or on tourist visas to work in massage parlours disguised as private apartments ... The permit is sought by the owner of the establishment, in most cases so-called ‘cabarets’, for the women in question.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">35. The study conducted by the Mediterranean Institute of Gender Studies (MIGS) led to a report on trafficking in human beings published in October 2007. It shows that an estimated 2 000 foreign women enter the island every year with short term ‘artiste’ or ‘entertainment’ work permits. Over the 20-year period 1982-2002, there was a dramatic increase of 111% in the number of cabarets operating on the island ...</span></p><p class="sFD4D42B6"><span class="sBB9EE52A">36. During his visit the Commissioner learned that there are now approximately 120</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">cabaret establishments in the Republic of Cyprus, each of them employing around 10 to 15 women ...” </span><span class="sA36B60A1">(footnotes omitted)</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">102.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Commissioner noted that the Government had passed comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation criminalising all forms of trafficking, prescribing up to 20 years’ imprisonment for sexual exploitation and providing for protection and support measures for victims (see paragraphs 127 to 131 below). He also visited the new government-run shelter in operation since November 2007 and was impressed by the facility and the commitment shown by staff. As regards allegations of corruption in the police force, and the report noted as follows:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“42. The Commissioner was assured that allegations of trafficking-related corruption within the police force were isolated cases. The authorities informed the Commissioner that so far, three disciplinary cases involving human trafficking/prostitution have been investigated: one resulted in an acquittal and two are still under investigation. In addition, in 2006, a member of the police force was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment and was subsequently dismissed from service following trafficking related charges.”</span></p><p class="sEC2CB098"><span class="sBB9EE52A">103.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The report drew the following conclusions in respect of the artiste permit regime in Cyprus:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“45. The Commissioner reiterates that trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation is a pressing and complex human rights issues faced by a number of Council of Europe member States, including Cyprus. A paradox certainly exists that while the Cypriot government has made legislative efforts to fight trafficking in human beings and expressed its willingness through their National Action Plan 2005, it continues to issue work permits for so-called cabaret artistes and licences for the cabaret establishments. While on paper the permits are issued to those women who will engage in some type of artistic performance, the reality is that many, if not most, of these women are expected to work as prostitutes.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">46. The existence of the ‘artiste’ work permit leads to a situation which makes it very difficult for law enforcement authorities to prove coercion and trafficking and effectively combat it. This type of permit could thus be perceived as contradicting the measures taken against trafficking or at least as rendering them ineffective.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">47. For these reasons, the Commissioner regrets that the ‘artiste’ work permit is still in place today despite the fact that the government has previously expressed its commitment to abolish it. It seems that the special information leaflet given to women entering the country on such a permit is of little effect, even though the woman needs to have read and signed the leaflet in the presence of an official.</span></p><p class="sFD4D42B6"><span class="sBB9EE52A">48.

Most identified victims of trafficking are women but men also are sometimes victims of trafficking in human beings. Furthermore, many of the victims are young, sometimes children.

In this regard, it is noted that awareness of the problem of trafficking of human beings and the need to take action to combat it has grown in recent years, as demonstrated by the adoption of measures at international level as well as the introduction of relevant domestic legislation in a number of States (see also paragraphs 264 and 269 below). The reports of the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights and the report of the Cypriot Ombudsman highlight the acute nature of the problem in Cyprus, where it is widely acknowledged that trafficking and sexual exploitation of cabaret artistes is of particular concern (see paragraphs 83, 89, 91, 94, 100 to 101 and 103 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">200.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Second, the Court draws attention to the paucity of case-law on the interpretation and application of Article 4 of the Convention in the context of trafficking cases. It is particularly significant that the Court has yet to rule on whether, and if so to what extent, Article 4 requires member States to take positive steps to protect potential victims of trafficking outside the framework of criminal investigations and prosecutions.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">201.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Cypriot Government have admitted that violations of the Convention occurred in the period leading up to and following Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s death. They have taken additional recent steps to investigate the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s death and have proposed a sum in respect of just satisfaction. However, in light of the Court’s duty to elucidate, safeguard and develop the rules instituted by the Convention, this is insufficient to allow the Court to conclude that it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the application. In view of the observations outlined above, there is a need for continued examination of cases which raise trafficking issues.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">202.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In conclusion, the Court finds that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention requires the continuation of the examination of the case.

The Court observes that such complaints are not predicated on the assertion that Russia was responsible for acts committed in Cyprus or by the Cypriot authorities. In light of the fact that the alleged trafficking commenced in Russia and in view of the obligations undertaken by Russia to combat trafficking, it is not outside the Court’s competence to examine whether Russia complied with any obligation it may have had to take measures within the limits of its own jurisdiction and powers to protect Ms Rantseva from trafficking and to investigate the possibility that she had been trafficked. Similarly, the applicant’s Article 2 complaint against the Russian authorities concerns their failure to take investigative measures, including securing evidence from witnesses resident in Russia. It is for the Court to assess in its examination of the merits of the applicant’s Article 2 complaint the extent of any procedural obligation incumbent on the Russian authorities and whether any such obligation was discharged in the circumstances of the present case.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">208.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In conclusion, the Court is competent to examine the extent to which Russia could have taken steps within the limits of its own territorial sovereignty to protect the applicant’s daughter from trafficking, to investigate allegations of trafficking and to investigate the circumstances leading to her death.

Although Ms Rantseva had left her employment at the cabaret, she had not submitted any complaint regarding her employer or the conditions of her work.

In the first place, this obligation requires the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. However, it also implies, in appropriate circumstances, a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Osman</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 115; </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Medova v.

Not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For the Court to find a violation of the positive obligation to protect life, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Osman</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 116; </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Paul and Audrey Edwards</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 55; and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Medova</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 96).</span></p><p class="s8378218E"><span class="s29100277">b.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Application of the general principles to the present case</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">220.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court must examine whether the Cypriot authorities could have foreseen that in releasing Ms Rantseva into the custody of M.A., her life would be at real and immediate risk.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">221.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court observes that in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Opuz</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, the responsibility of the State was engaged because the person who subsequently went on to shoot and kill the applicant’s mother had previously made death threats and committed acts of violence against the applicant and her mother, of which the authorities were aware (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Opuz</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 133 to 136).

In the present case, even if the police ought to have been aware that Ms Rantseva might have been a victim of trafficking (a matter to be examined in the context of the applicant’s Article 4 complaint, below), there were no indications during the time spent at the police station that Ms Rantseva’s life was at real and immediate risk. The Court considers that particular chain of events leading to Ms Rantseva’s death could not have been foreseeable to the police officers when they released her into M.A.’s custody.

He pointed to alleged contradictions between the autopsies of the Cypriot and Russian authorities (see paragraph 50 above) and his requests to Cyprus, via the relevant Russian authorities, for further investigation of apparent anomalies, requests which were not followed up by the Cypriot authorities (see paragraphs 52 and 62 above). He also complained about the limited number of witness statements taken by the police (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above), highlighting that five of the seven relevant statements were either from the police officers on duty at Limassol Police Station or those present in the apartment at the time of his daughter’s death, persons who, in his view, had an interest in presenting a particular version of events. The applicant further argued that any investigation should not depend on an official complaint or claim from the victim’s relatives. He contended that his daughter clearly died in strange circumstances requiring elaboration and that an Article 2-compliant investigation was accordingly required. The Cypriot investigation did not comply with Article 2 due to the inadequacies outlined above, as well as the fact that it was not accessible to him, as a relative of the victim.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">225.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Specifically, as regards the inquest, the applicant complained that he was not advised of the date of the final inquest hearing, which prevented his participation in it. He was not informed of the progress of the case or of other remedies available to him. He alleged that he only received the District Court’s conclusion in the inquest proceedings on 16 April 2003, some 15 months after the proceedings had ended. Furthermore, the Cypriot authorities failed to provide him with free legal assistance, when the cost of legal representation in Cyprus was prohibitive for him.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">226.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the Russian Federation, the applicant argued that the fact that his daughter was a citizen of the Russian Federation meant that even though she was temporarily resident in Cyprus and her death occurred there, the Russian Federation also had an obligation under Article 2 to investigate the circumstances of her arrival in Cyprus, her employment there and her subsequent death. He submitted that the Russian authorities should have applied to the Cypriot authorities under the Legal Assistance Treaty to initiate criminal proceedings in accordance with Articles 5 and 36 (see paragraphs 181 and 207 above), as he had requested. Instead, the Russian authorities merely sought information concerning the circumstances of Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s death. The applicant’s subsequent application to the relevant authorities in Russia to initiate criminal proceedings was refused by the Chelyabinsk Prosecutor’s Office as Ms Rantseva died outside Russia. His repeated requests that Russian authorities take statements from two Russian nationals resident in Russia were refused as the Russian authorities considered that they were unable to take the action requested without a legal assistance request from the Cypriot authorities. The applicant concluded that these failures meant that the Russian authorities had not conducted an effective investigation into the death of his daughter, as required by Article 2 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s8378218E"><span class="s29100277">b.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The Cypriot Government</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">227.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In their written submissions, the Cypriot Government conceded that an obligation to conduct an effective investigation arose under Article 2 where State agents were involved in events leading to an individual’s death, but contended that not every tragic death required that special steps by way of inquiry should be taken. In the present case, the Cypriot authorities did not have an obligation to conduct an investigation into the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s death but nonetheless did so. Although the exact circumstances leading to Ms Rantseva’s death remained unclear, the Cypriot Government contested the allegation that there were failures in the investigation. The investigation was carried out by the police and was capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Reasonable steps were taken to secure relevant evidence and an inquest was held.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">228.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As far as the inquest was concerned, the Cypriot Government submitted that the applicant was advised by the Cypriot authorities of the date of the inquest hearing. Moreover, the inquest was adjourned twice because the applicant was not present. The Cypriot Government pointed to the delay of the Russian authorities in advising the Cypriot authorities of the applicant’s request for adjournment: the request only arrived four months after the inquest had been concluded. Had the court been aware of the applicant’s request, it might have adjourned the hearing again. All other requests by the applicant had been addressed and relevant Cypriot authorities had sought to assist the applicant where possible.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In respect of the applicant’s complaint regarding legal aid, the Cypriot Government pointed out that the applicant did not apply through the correct procedures. He should have applied under the Law on Legal Aid; the Legal Assistance Treaty, invoked by the applicant, did not provide for legal aid but for free legal assistance, which was quite different.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">229.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In their unilateral declaration (see paragraph 187 above), the Cypriot Government confirmed that three independent criminal investigators had recently been appointed to investigate the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s death and the extent of any criminal responsibility of any person or authority for her death.</span></p><p class="s8378218E"><span class="s29100277">c.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The Russian Government</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">230.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Russian Government accepted that at the relevant time, Russian criminal law did not provide for the possibility of bringing criminal proceedings in Russia against non-Russian nationals in respect of a crime committed outside Russian territory against a Russian national, although the law had since been changed. In any event, the applicant did not request the Russian authorities to institute criminal proceedings themselves but merely requested assistance in establishing the circumstances leading to his daughter’s death in Cyprus. Accordingly, no preliminary investigation into Ms Rantseva’s death was conducted in Russia and no evidence was obtained. Although the applicant requested on a number of occasions that the Russian authorities take evidence from two young Russian women who had worked with Ms Rantseva, as he was advised, the Russian authorities were unable to take the action requested in the absence of a legal assistance request from the Cypriot authorities. The Russian authorities informed the Cypriot authorities that they were ready to execute any such request but no request was forthcoming.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">231.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Russian Government contended that the Russian authorities took all possible measures to establish the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s death, to render assistance to the Cypriot authorities in their investigations and to protect and reinstate the applicant’s rights.

The obligation to conduct an effective official investigation also arises where death occurs in suspicious circumstances not imputable to State agents (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Menson v. the United Kingdom </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">(dec.), no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;47916/99&quot;]}" target="_blank">47916/99</a>, ECHR 2003</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">V). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. The authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, for example, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">İlhan v.

This requires not only hierarchical or institutional independence but also practical independence (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;24746/94&quot;]}" target="_blank">24746/94</a>, § 120, ECHR 2001</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">III (extracts); and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;30054/96&quot;]}" target="_blank">30054/96</a>, § 114, 4 May 2001). The investigation must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Paul and Audrey Edwards</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 71). A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in the context of an effective investigation within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Yaşa v.

However, as noted above (see paragraph 232 above), this does not preclude the existence of an obligation to investigate her death under Article 2 (see also </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">[GC], no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;32967/96&quot;]}" target="_blank">32967/96</a>, §§ 48 to 50, ECHR 2002</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">I; and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Öneryıldız v.

In light of the ambiguous and unexplained circumstances surrounding Ms Rantseva’s death and the allegations of trafficking, ill-treatment and unlawful detention in the period leading up to her death, the Court considers that a procedural obligation did arise in respect of the Cypriot authorities to investigate the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s death. By necessity, the investigation was required to consider not only the immediate context of Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s fall from the balcony but also the broader context of Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s arrival and stay in Cyprus, in order to assess whether there was a link between the allegations of trafficking and Ms Rantseva’s subsequent death.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">235.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the adequacy of the investigation, the Court notes that the police arrived quickly and sealed off the scene within minutes. Photographs were taken and a forensic examination was carried out (see paragraph 32 above). That same morning, the police took statements from those present in the apartment when Ms Rantseva died and from the neighbour who had witnessed the fall. The police officers on duty at Limassol Police Station also made statements (see paragraph 33 above). An autopsy was carried out and an inquest was held (see paragraphs 35 to 41 above).</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, there are a number of elements of the investigation which were unsatisfactory.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">236.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">First, there was conflicting testimony from those present in the apartment which the Cypriot investigating authorities appear to have taken no steps to resolve (see paragraphs 22 to 24 and 26 to 28 above). Similarly, inconsistencies emerge from the evidence taken as to Ms Rantseva’s physical condition, and in particular as to the extent of the effects of alcohol on her conduct (see paragraphs 18, 20 to 21 and 24 above). There are other apparent anomalies, such as the alleged inconsistencies between the forensic reports of the Cypriot and Russian authorities and the fact that Ms Rantseva made no noise as she fell from the balcony, for which no satisfactory explanation has been provided (see paragraphs 29, 50 to 52 and 67 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">237.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Second, the verdict at the inquest recorded that Ms Rantseva had died in “strange circumstances” in an attempt to escape from the apartment in which she was a “guest” (see paragraph 41 above). Despite the lack of clarity surrounding the circumstances of her death, no effort was made by the Cypriot police to question those who lived with Ms Rantseva or worked with her in the cabaret. Further, notwithstanding the striking conclusion of the inquest that Ms Rantseva was trying to escape from the apartment, no attempt was made to establish why she was trying to escape or to clarify whether she had been detained in the apartment against her will.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">238.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Third, aside from the initial statements of the two police officers and passport officer on duty made on 28 and 29 March 2001, there was apparently no investigation into what had occurred at the police station, and in particular why the police had handed Ms Rantseva into the custody of M.A.. It is clear from the witness statements that the AIS considered M.A. to be responsible for Ms Rantseva but the reasons for, and the appropriateness of, this conclusion have never been fully investigated. Further, the statements of the police officers do not refer to any statement being taken from Ms Rantseva and there is nothing in the investigation file to explain why this was not done; a statement was made by M.A. (see paragraph 19 above). The Court recalls that the Council of Europe Commissioner reported in 2008 that he was assured that allegations of trafficking-related corruption within the police force were isolated cases (see paragraph 102 above). However, in light of the facts of the present case, the Court considers that the authorities were under an obligation to investigate whether there was any indication of corruption within the police force in respect of the events leading to Ms Rantseva’s death.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">239.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Fourth, despite his clear request to the Cypriot authorities, the applicant was not personally advised of the date of the inquest and as a consequence was not present when the verdict was handed down. The Cypriot Government do not dispute the applicant’s claim that he was only advised of the inquest finding 15 months after the hearing had taken place. Accordingly, the Cypriot authorities failed to ensure that the applicant was able to participate effectively in the proceedings, despite his strenuous efforts to remain involved.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">240.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Fifth, the applicant’s continued requests for investigation, via the Russian authorities, appear to have gone unheeded by the Cypriot authorities. In particular, his requests for information as to further remedies open to him within the Cypriot legal order, as well as requests for free legal assistance from the Cypriot authorities, were ignored. The Cypriot Government’s response in their written observations before the Court that the request for legal assistance had been made under the wrong instrument is unsatisfactory. Given the applicant’s repeated requests and the gravity of the case in question, the Cypriot Government ought, at the very least, to have advised the applicant of the appropriate procedure for making a request for free legal assistance.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">241.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Finally, for an investigation into a death to be effective, member States must take such steps as are necessary and available in order to secure relevant evidence, whether or not it is located in the territory of the investigating State. The Court observes that both Cyprus and Russia are parties to the Mutual Assistance Convention and have, in addition, concluded the bilateral Legal Assistance Treaty (see paragraphs 175 to 185 above). These instruments set out a clear procedure by which the Cypriot authorities could have sought assistance from Russia in investigating the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s stay in Cyprus and her subsequent death. The Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation provided an unsolicited undertaking that Russia would assist in any request for legal assistance by Cyprus aimed at the collection of further evidence (see paragraph 70 above). However, there is no evidence that the Cypriot authorities sought any legal assistance from Russia in the context of their investigation. In the circumstances, the Court finds the Cypriot authorities’ refusal to make a legal assistance request to obtain the testimony of the two Russian women who worked with Ms Rantseva at the cabaret particularly unfortunate given the value of such testimony in helping to clarify matters which were central to the investigation. Although Ms Rantseva died in 2001, the applicant is still waiting for a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances leading to her death.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">242. The Court accordingly finds that there has been a procedural violation of Article 2 of the Convention as regards the failure of the Cypriot authorities to conduct an effective investigation into Ms Rantseva’s death.</span></p><p class="sCA71A5BA"><span class="sA36B60A1">ii.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Russia</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">243.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court recalls that Ms Rantseva’s death took place in Cyprus. Accordingly, unless it can be shown that there are special features in the present case which require a departure from the general approach, the obligation to ensure an effective official investigation applies to Cyprus alone (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">[GC], no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;35763/97&quot;]}" target="_blank">35763/97</a>, § 38, ECHR 2001</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">XI).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">244.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the existence of special features, the applicant relies on the fact that Ms Rantseva was a Russian national. However, the Court does not consider that Article 2 requires member States’ criminal laws to provide for universal jurisdiction in cases involving the death of one of their nationals. There are no other special features which would support the imposition of a duty on Russia to conduct its own investigation. Accordingly, the Court concludes that there was no free-standing obligation incumbent on the Russian authorities under Article 2 of the Convention to investigate Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s death.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">245.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, the corollary of the obligation on an investigating State to secure evidence located in other jurisdictions is a duty on the State where evidence is located to render any assistance within its competence and means sought under a legal assistance request. In the present case, as noted above, the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, referring to the evidence of the two Russian women, expressed willingness to comply with any mutual legal assistance request forwarded to the Russian authorities and to organise the taking of the witness testimony, but no such request was forthcoming (see paragraph 241 above). The applicant argued that the Russian authorities should have proceeded to interview the two women notwithstanding the absence of any request from the Cypriot authorities. However, the Court recalls that the responsibility for investigating Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s death lay with Cyprus. In the absence of a legal assistance request, the Russian authorities were not required under Article 2 to secure the evidence themselves.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">246.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the applicant’s complaint that the Russian authorities failed to request the initiation of criminal proceedings, the Court observes that the Russian authorities made extensive use of the opportunities presented by mutual legal assistance agreements to press for action by the Cypriot authorities (see, for example, paragraphs 48, 52, 55, 57 and 61 to 62 above). In particular, by letter dated 11 December 2001, they requested that further investigation be conducted into Ms Rantseva’s death, that relevant witnesses be interviewed and that the Cypriot authorities bring charges of murder, kidnapping or unlawful deprivation of freedom in respect of Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s death (see paragraph 52 above). By letter dated 27 December 2001, a specific request was made to institute criminal proceedings (see paragraph 53 above). The request was reiterated on several occasions.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">247.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In conclusion, the Court finds that there has been no procedural violation of Article 2 by the Russian Federation.</span></p><p class="s9F223FEE"><span class="sBB9EE52A">IV.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION</span></p><p class="s507703F"><span class="sBB9EE52A">248.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant alleged a violation of Article 3 of the Convention by the Cypriot authorities in respect of their failure to take steps to protect Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva from ill-treatment and to investigate whether Ms Rantseva was subject to inhuman or degrading treatment in the period leading up to her death.

He contended that the two forensic reports conducted following Ms Rantseva’s death revealed that the explanation of her death did not accord with the injuries recorded. He argued that the witness testimony gathered did not provide a satisfactory response to the question whether there were injuries present on Ms Rantseva’s body prior to her death. Despite this, no investigation was conducted by the Cypriot authorities into whether Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva had been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. Further, no steps were taken to avoid the risk of ill treatment to Ms Rantseva in circumstances where the authorities knew or ought to have known of a real and immediate risk. Accordingly, in the applicant’s submission, there was a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Cypriot Government</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">250.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In their written submissions, the Cypriot Government denied that any violation of Article 3 had occurred. They pointed out that nothing in the investigation file suggested that Ms Rantseva had been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment prior to her death. In any event, a thorough investigation, capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible, was conducted into the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s death. The investigation therefore complied with Article 3.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">251.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In their subsequent unilateral declaration (see paragraph 187 above), the Cypriot Government acknowledged that there had been a breach of the procedural obligation arising under Article 3 of the Convention in so far as the police investigation into whether Ms Rantseva was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment prior to her death was ineffective. They also confirmed that three independent investigators had been appointed to investigate the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s employment and stay in Cyprus and whether she had been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment.</span></p><p class="s7EE1C8F0"><span class="s29100277">B.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The Court’s assessment</span></p><p class="s401C450A"><span class="sBB9EE52A">252.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes that there is no evidence that Ms Rantseva was subjected to ill-treatment prior to her death. However, it is clear that the use of violence and the ill-treatment of victims are common features of trafficking (see paragraphs 85, 87 to 88 and 101 above). The Court therefore considers that, in the absence of any specific allegations of ill-treatment, any inhuman or degrading treatment suffered by Ms Rantseva prior to her death was inherently linked to the alleged trafficking and exploitation. Accordingly, the Court concludes that it is not necessary to consider separately the applicant’s Article 3 complaint and will deal with the general issues raised in the context of its examination of the applicant’s complaint under Article 4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s9F223FEE"><span class="sBB9EE52A">V.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 4 OF THE CONVENTION</span></p><p class="s507703F"><span class="sBB9EE52A">253.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant alleged a violation of Article 4 of the Convention by both the Russian and Cypriot authorities in light of their failure to protect his daughter from being trafficked and their failure to conduct an effective investigation into the circumstances of her arrival in Cyprus and the nature of her employment there.

He pointed to the reports of the Council of Europe’s Commissioner on Human Rights (see paragraphs 91 to 104 above), which he said demonstrated that there had been a deterioration in the situation of young foreign women moving to Cyprus to work as cabaret artistes. He concluded that the obligations incumbent on Cyprus to combat trafficking had not been met. In particular, the applicant pointed out that the Cypriot authorities were unable to explain why they had handed Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva over to her former employer at the police station instead of releasing her (see paragraph 82 above). He contended that in so doing, the Cypriot authorities had failed to take measures to protect his daughter from trafficking. They had also failed to conduct any investigation into whether his daughter had been a victim of trafficking or had been subjected to sexual or other exploitation. Although Ms Rantseva had entered Cyprus voluntarily to work in the cabaret, the Court had established that prior consent, without more, does not negate a finding of compulsory labour (referring to </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Van der Mussele v. Belgium</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 23 November 1983, § 36, Series A no. 70).</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">255.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In respect of Russia, the applicant pointed out that at the relevant time, the Russian Criminal Code did not contain provisions which expressly addressed trafficking in human beings. He argued that the Russian authorities were aware of the particular problem of young women being trafficked to Cyprus to work in the sex industry. Accordingly, the Russian Federation was under an obligation to adopt measures to prevent the trafficking and exploitation of Russian women but had failed to do so.</span><span class="sE208486F"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the present case, it was under a specific obligation to investigate the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s arrival in Cyprus and the nature of her employment there, but no such investigation had been carried out.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Cypriot Government</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">256.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In their written observations, the Cypriot Government confirmed that no measures were taken in the period prior to or following Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s death to ascertain whether she had been a victim of trafficking in human beings or whether she had been subjected to sexual or other forms of exploitation. However they denied that there had been a violation of Article 4 of the Convention.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">They conceded that there were positive obligations on the State which required the penalisation and effective prosecution of any act aimed at maintaining a person in a situation of slavery, servitude or forced or compulsory labour. However, they argued by analogy with Articles 2 and 3 that positive obligations only arose where the authorities knew or ought to have known of a real and immediate risk that an identified individual was being held in such a situation. These positive obligations would only be violated where the authorities subsequently failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">257.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the present case, there was nothing in the investigation file, nor was there any other evidence, to indicate that Ms Rantseva was held in slavery or servitude or was required to perform forced or compulsory labour. The Cypriot Government further pointed to the fact that no complaint had been lodged with the domestic authorities by the applicant that his daughter had been a victim of trafficking or exploitation and that none of the correspondence from the Russian authorities made any reference to such a complaint. Ms Rantseva herself had made no allegations of that nature prior to her death and the note she left in her apartment saying she was tired and was going back to Russia (see paragraph 17 above) was inadequate to support any such allegations. The Government claimed that the first time that any complaint of this nature was made to the authorities was on 13 April 2006, by a Russian Orthodox priest in Limassol. They argued that the Russian authorities had failed to cooperate with the Cypriot authorities and take witness statements from two Russian women who had worked with Ms Rantseva at the cabaret.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">258.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In their subsequent unilateral declaration (see paragraph 187 above), the Cypriot Government accepted that they had violated their positive obligations under Article 4 in failing to take any measures to ascertain whether Ms Rantseva had been a victim of trafficking in human beings or had been subjected to sexual or any other kind of exploitation. They also confirmed that three independent investigators had been appointed to investigate the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s employment and stay in Cyprus and whether there was any evidence that she was a victim of trafficking or exploitation.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">3.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Russian Government</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">259.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As noted above, the Russian Government contested that Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva’s treatment in the present case fell within the scope of Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4 (see paragraph 209 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">260.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On the merits, the Russian Government agreed that the positive obligations arising under Article 4 required member States to ensure that residents were not being kept in slavery or servitude or being forced to work. Where such a case did occur, member States were required to put in place an effective framework for the protection and reinstatement of victims’ rights and for the prosecution of guilty persons. However, in so far as the applicant’s complaint was directed against Russia, his argument was that the Russian authorities ought to have put in place a system of preventative measures to protect citizens going abroad. The Russian Government pointed out that any such measures would have had to strike a balance between Article 4 and the right to free movement guaranteed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 of the Convention, which provides that “[e]veryone shall be free to leave any country, including his own”. They also argued that the scope of any such measures was significantly restricted by the need to respect the sovereignty of the State to which the citizen wished to travel.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">261.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">According to the Russian Government, there was a wealth of measures set out in Russian criminal law to prevent violations of Article 4, to protect victims and to prosecute perpetrators. Although at the relevant time Russian criminal law did not contain provisions on human trafficking and slave labour, such conduct would nonetheless have fallen within the definitions of other crimes such as threats to kill or cause grave harm to health, abduction, unlawful deprivation of liberty and sexual crimes (see paragraphs 133 to 135). The Russian Government also pointed to various international treaties ratified by the Russian Federation, including the Slavery Convention 1926 (see paragraphs 137 to 141above) and the Palermo Protocol 2000 (see paragraphs 149 to 155 above), and highlighted that Russia had signed up to a number of mutual legal assistance agreements (see paragraphs 175 to 185 above). In the present case, they had taken active measures to press for the identification and punishment of guilty persons within the framework of mutual legal assistance treaties. They further explained that on 27 July 2006, the application of the Criminal Code was extended to allow the prosecution of non-nationals who had committed crimes against Russian nationals outside Russian territory. However, the exercise of this power depended on the consent of the State in whose territory the offence was committed.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">262.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the departure of Ms Rantseva for Cyprus, the Russian authorities pointed out that they only became aware of a citizen leaving Russia at the point at which an individual crossed the border. Where entry requirements of the State of destination were complied with, and in the absence of any circumstances preventing the exit, the Russian authorities were not permitted to prohibit a person from exercising his right of free movement. Accordingly, the Russian authorities could only make recommendations and warn its citizens against possible dangers. They did provide warnings, via the media, as well as more detailed information regarding the risk factors.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">263.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Russian Government also requested the Court to consider that there had been no previous findings of a violation of Article 4 against Cyprus. They submitted that they were entitled to take this into consideration in the development of their relations with Cyprus.</span></p><p class="sB6F98828"><span class="sA36B60A1">4.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Third party submissions</span></p><p class="s360DA689"><span class="s29100277">a.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Interights</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">264.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Interights highlighted the growing awareness of human trafficking and the adoption of a number of international and regional instruments seeking to combat it. However, they considered national policies and measures in the field to be at times inadequate and ineffective. They argued that the paramount requirement for any legal system effectively to address human trafficking was recognition of the need for a multidisciplinary approach; cooperation among States; and a legal framework with an integrated human rights approach.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">265.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Interights emphasised that a distinctive element of human trafficking was the irrelevance of the victim’s consent to the intended exploitation where any of the means of coercion listed in the Palermo Protocol had been used (see paragraph 151 above). Accordingly, a person who was aware that she was to work in the sex industry was not excluded by virtue of that awareness from being a victim of trafficking. Of further importance was the distinction between smuggling, which concerned primarily the protection of the State against illegal migration, and trafficking, which was a crime against individuals and did not necessarily involve a cross-border element.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">266.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Asserting that human trafficking was a form of modern-day slavery, Interights highlighted the conclusions of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the case of </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Prosecutor v Kunarac et al</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (see paragraphs 142 to 143 above) and argued that the necessary consequence of that judgment was that the definition of slavery did not require a right of ownership over a person to exist but merely that one or more of the powers attached to such a right be present. Thus the modern-day understanding of the term “slavery” could include situations where the victim was subject to violence and coercion thereby giving the perpetrator total control over the victim.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">267.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> Interights addressed the positive obligations of member States under the Convention in the context of trafficking in human beings. In particular, there was, Interights contended, an obligation to enact appropriate legislation on trafficking in human beings, as set out in the Anti-Trafficking Convention (see paragraphs 160 to 174 above) and supported by the case-law of the Court. Such legislation was required to criminalise trafficking in human beings, establishing liability of legal as well as natural persons; to introduce review procedures in respect of the licensing and operation of businesses often used as a cover for human trafficking; and to establish appropriate penalties. Other positive obligations included obligations to discourage demand for human trafficking, to ensure an adequate law enforcement response to identify and eradicate any involvement of law enforcement officials in human trafficking offences and build victims’ confidence in the police and judicial systems and to ensure that the identification of victims of trafficking took place efficiently and effectively by introducing relevant training. Research on best practices, methods and strategies, raising awareness in the media and civil society, information campaigns involving public authorities and policy makers, educational programmes and targeting sex tourism were also areas of possible State action identified by Interights.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">268.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Finally, Interights argued that there was an implied positive obligation on States to carry out an effective and diligent investigation into allegations of trafficking. Such investigation should comply with the conditions of investigations required under Article 2 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s8378218E"><span class="s29100277">b.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The AIRE Centre</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">269.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The AIRE Centre highlighted the increasing number of people, the majority of whom were women and children, who fell victim to trafficking for the purposes of sexual or other exploitation each year. They pointed to the severe physical and psychological consequences for victims, which frequently rendered them too traumatised to present themselves as victims of trafficking to the relevant authorities. They referred in particular to the conclusions of a report by the U.S. State Department in 2008, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Trafficking in Persons Report</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, which found that Cyprus had failed to provide evidence that it had increased its efforts to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons from the previous year (see paragraph 106 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">270.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">More generally, the AIRE Centre highlighted their concern that the rights of victims of human trafficking were often subordinated to other goals in the fight against trafficking. International and regional instruments on human trafficking often lacked practical and effective rights for the protection of victims. Apart from requirements regarding the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offences, the provisions of the Palermo Protocol on protection of victims were, the AIRE Centre argued, “generally either hortatory or aspirational”, obliging States to “consider” or “endeavour to” introduce certain measures.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">271.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Finally, the AIRE Centre noted that the jurisprudence of supervisory bodies for international instruments against trafficking had yet to address fully the extent and content of positive obligations owed by States in the circumstances arising in the present application. As regards the jurisprudence of this Court, the AIRE Centre noted that although the Court had already been called upon to consider the extent of the application of Article 4 in a trafficking case (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above), that case had dealt exclusively with the failure of the State to put in place adequate criminal law provisions to prevent and punish the perpetrators. Referring to the case-law developed in the context of Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the Convention, the AIRE Centre argued that States had a positive obligation to provide protection where they knew or ought to have known that an individual was, or was at risk of being, a victim of human trafficking. The particular measures required would depend on the circumstances but States were not permitted to leave such an individual unprotected or to return her to a situation of trafficking and exploitation.</span></p><p class="s684F2214"><span class="s29100277">B.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The Court’s assessment</span></p><p class="s25BD2B45"><span class="sA36B60A1">1.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Application of Article 4 of the Convention</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">272.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The first question which arises is whether the present case falls within the ambit of Article 4. The Court recalls that Article 4 makes no mention of trafficking, proscribing “slavery”, “servitude” and “forced and compulsory labour”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">273.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court has never considered the provisions of the Convention as the sole framework of reference for the interpretation of the rights and freedoms enshrined therein (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Demir and Baykara v.

The Court must have regard to the fact that the context of the provision is a treaty for the effective protection of individual human rights and that the Convention must be read as a whole, and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (dec.)

The Convention was inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948, which itself made no express mention of trafficking. In its Article 4, the Declaration prohibited “slavery and the slave trade in all their forms”. However, in assessing the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, sight should not be lost of the Convention’s special features or of the fact that it is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions. The increasingly high standards required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably require greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (see, among many other authorities, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Selmouni v.

In Europe, its growth has been facilitated in part by the collapse of former Communist blocs.

In that case, the Court concluded that the treatment suffered by the applicant amounted to servitude and forced and compulsory labour, although it fell short of slavery. In light of the proliferation of both trafficking itself and of measures taken to combat it, the Court considers it appropriate in the present case to examine the extent to which trafficking itself may be considered to run counter to the spirit and purpose of Article 4 of the Convention such as to fall within the scope of the guarantees offered by that Article without the need to assess which of the three types of proscribed conduct are engaged by the particular treatment in the case in question.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">280.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court observes that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia concluded that the traditional concept of “slavery” has evolved to encompass various contemporary forms of slavery based on the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership (see paragraph 142 above). In assessing whether a situation amounts to a contemporary form of slavery, the Tribunal held that relevant factors included whether there was control of a person’s movement or physical environment, whether there was an element of psychological control, whether measures were taken to prevent or deter escape and whether there was control of sexuality and forced labour (see paragraph 143 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">281.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court considers that trafficking in human beings, by its very nature and aim of exploitation, is based on the exercise of powers attaching to the right of ownership. It treats human beings as commodities to be bought and sold and put to forced labour, often for little or no payment, usually in the sex industry but also elsewhere (see paragraphs 101 and 161 above). It implies close surveillance of the activities of victims, whose movements are often circumscribed (see paragraphs 85 and 101 above). It involves the use of violence and threats against victims, who live and work under poor conditions (see paragraphs 85, 87 to 88 and 101 above). It is described by Interights and in the explanatory report accompanying the Anti-Trafficking Convention as the modern form of the old worldwide slave trade (see paragraphs 161 and 266 above). The Cypriot Ombudsman referred to sexual exploitation and trafficking taking place “under a regime of modern slavery” (see paragraph 84 above).</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">282.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">There can be no doubt that trafficking threatens the human dignity and fundamental freedoms of its victims and cannot be considered compatible with a democratic society and the values expounded in the Convention.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In view of its obligation to interpret the Convention in light of present-day conditions, the Court considers it unnecessary to identify whether the treatment about which the applicant complains constitutes “slavery”, “servitude” or “forced and compulsory labour”.

The Court considers that the spectrum of safeguards set out in national legislation must be adequate to ensure the practical and effective protection of the rights of victims or potential victims of trafficking. Accordingly, in addition to criminal law measures to punish traffickers, Article 4 requires member States to put in place adequate measures regulating businesses often used as a cover for human trafficking. Furthermore, a State’s immigration rules must address relevant concerns relating to encouragement, facilitation or tolerance of trafficking (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Guerra and Others v.

In order to comply with this obligation, member States are required to put in place a legislative and administrative framework to prohibit and punish trafficking. The Court observes that the Palermo Protocol and the Anti-Trafficking Convention refer to the need for a comprehensive approach to combat trafficking which includes measures to prevent trafficking and to protect victims, in addition to measures to punish traffickers (see paragraphs 149 and 163 above). It is clear from the provisions of these two instruments that the Contracting States, including almost all of the member States of the Council of Europe, have formed the view that only a combination of measures addressing all three aspects can be effective in the fight against trafficking (see also the submissions of Interights and the AIRE Centre at paragraphs 267 and 271 above). Accordingly, the duty to penalise and prosecute trafficking is only one aspect of member States’ general undertaking to combat trafficking. The extent of the positive obligations arising under Article 4 must be considered within this broader context.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">286.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As with Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, Article 4 may, in certain circumstances, require a State to take operational measures to protect victims, or potential victims, of trafficking (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Osman</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">115; and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Mahmut Kaya v.

In the case of an answer in the affirmative, there will be a violation of Article 4 of the Convention where the authorities fail to take appropriate measures within the scope of their powers to remove the individual from that situation or risk (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Osman</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§116 to 117; and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Mahmut Kaya</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 115 to 116).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">287.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Bearing in mind the difficulties involved in policing modern societies and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, the obligation to take operational measures must, however, be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Osman</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 116). It is relevant to the consideration of the proportionality of any positive obligation arising in the present case that the Palermo Protocol, signed by both Cyprus and the Russian Federation in 2000, requires States to endeavour to provide for the physical safety of victims of trafficking while in their territories and to establish comprehensive policies and programmes to prevent and combat trafficking (see paragraphs 153 to 154 above). States are also required to provide relevant training for law enforcement and immigration officials (see paragraph 155 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">288.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Like Articles 2 and 3, Article 4 also entails a procedural obligation to investigate situations of potential trafficking. The requirement to investigate does not depend on a complaint from the victim or next-of-kin: once the matter has come to the attention of the authorities they must act of their own motion (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;46477/99&quot;]}" target="_blank">46477/99</a>, § 69, ECHR 2002</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">II). For an investigation to be effective, it must be independent from those implicated in the events. It must also be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of individuals responsible, an obligation not of result but of means. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in all cases but where the possibility of removing the individual from the harmful situation is available, the investigation must be undertaken as a matter of urgency. The victim or the next-of-kin must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Paul and Audrey Edwards</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 70 to 73).</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">289.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Finally, the Court reiterates that trafficking is a problem which is often not confined to the domestic arena. When a person is trafficked from one State to another, trafficking offences may occur in the State of origin, any State of transit and the State of destination. Relevant evidence and witnesses may be located in all States. Although the Palermo Protocol is silent on the question of jurisdiction, the Anti-Trafficking Convention explicitly requires each member State to establish jurisdiction over any trafficking offence committed in its territory (see paragraph 172 above). Such an approach is, in the Court’s view, only logical in light of the general obligation, outlined above, incumbent on all States under Article 4 of the Convention to investigate alleged trafficking offences. In addition to the obligation to conduct a domestic investigation into events occurring on their own territories, member States are also subject to a duty in cross-border trafficking cases to cooperate effectively with the relevant authorities of other States concerned in the investigation of events which occurred outside their territories. Such a duty is in keeping with the objectives of the member States, as expressed in the preamble to the Palermo Protocol, to adopt a comprehensive international approach to trafficking in the countries of origin, transit and destination (see paragraph 149 above). It is also consistent with international agreements on mutual legal assistance in which the respondent States participate in the present case (see paragraphs 175 to 185 above).</span></p><p class="sB6F98828"><span class="sA36B60A1">3.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Application of the general principles to the present case</span></p><ol type="a" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s1D45AC49"><span class="s67D4C4C3">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a name="_Ref244330121" class="bookmark"><span>Cyprus</span></a></li></ol><p class="s8C50CFA1"><span class="sA36B60A1">i.</span><span class="s8C736DEA">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Positive obligation to put in place an appropriate legislative and administrative framework</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">290.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court observes that in Cyprus legislation prohibiting trafficking and sexual exploitation was adopted in 2000 (see paragraphs 127 to 131 above). The law reflects the provisions of the Palermo Protocol and prohibits trafficking and sexual exploitation, with consent providing no defence to the offence. Severe penalties are set out in the legislation. The law also provides for a duty to protect victims, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">inter alia </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">through the appointment of a guardian of victims. Although the Ombudsman criticised the failure of the authorities to adopt practical implementing measures, she considered the law itself to be satisfactory (see paragraph 90 above). The Council of Europe Commissioner also found the legal framework established by Law 3(1) 2000 to be “suitable” (see paragraph 92 above). Notwithstanding the applicant’s complaint as to the inadequacy of Cypriot trafficking legislation, the Court does not consider that the circumstances of the present case give rise to any concern in this regard.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">291. However, as regards the general legal and administrative framework and the adequacy of Cypriot immigration policy, a number of weaknesses can be identified. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights noted in his 2003 report that the absence of an immigration policy and legislative shortcomings in this respect have encouraged the trafficking of women to Cyprus (see paragraph 91 above). He called for preventive control measures to be adopted to stem the flow of young women entering Cyprus to work as cabaret artistes (see paragraph 94 above). In subsequent reports, the Commissioner reiterated his concerns regarding the legislative framework, and in particular criticised the system whereby cabaret managers were required to make the application for an entry permit for the artiste as rendering the artiste dependent on her employer or agent and increasing her risk of falling into the hands of traffickers (see paragraph 100 above). In his 2008 report, the Commissioner criticised the artiste visa regime as making it very difficult for law enforcement authorities to take the necessary steps to combat trafficking, noting that the artiste permit could be perceived as contradicting the measures taken against trafficking or at least as rendering them ineffective (see also the report of the U.S. State Department at paragraphs 105 and 107 above). The Commissioner expressed regret that, despite concerns raised in previous reports and the Government’s commitment to abolish it, the artiste work permit was still in place (see paragraph 103 above). Similarly, the Ombudsman, in her 2003 report, blamed the artiste visa regime for the entry of thousands of young foreign women into Cyprus, where they were exploited by their employers under cruel living and working conditions (see paragraph 89 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">292.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Further, the Court emphasises that while an obligation on employers to notify the authorities when an artiste leaves her employment (see paragraph 117 above) is a legitimate measure to allow the authorities to monitor the compliance of immigrants with their immigration obligations, responsibility for ensuring compliance and for taking steps in cases of non-compliance must remain with the authorities themselves. Measures which encourage cabaret owners and managers to track down missing artistes or in some other way to take personal responsibility for the conduct of artistes are unacceptable in the broader context of trafficking concerns regarding artistes in Cyprus. Against this backdrop, the Court considers that the practice of requiring cabaret owners and managers to lodge a bank guarantee to cover potential future costs associated with artistes which they have employed (see paragraph 115 above) particularly troubling. The separate bond signed in Ms Rantseva’s case is of equal concern (see paragraph 15 above), as is the unexplained conclusion of the AIS that M.A. was responsible for Ms Rantseva and was therefore required to come and collect her from the police station (see paragraph 20 above).</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">293.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the circumstances, the Court concludes that the regime of artiste visas in Cyprus did not afford to Ms Rantseva practical and effective protection against trafficking and exploitation. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 4 in this regard.</span></p><p class="sCA71A5BA"><span class="sA36B60A1">ii. Positive obligation to take protective measures</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">294.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In assessing whether a positive obligation to take measures to protect Ms Rantseva arose in the present case, the Court considers the following to be significant. First, it is clear from the Ombudsman’s 2003 report that here has been a serious problem in Cyprus since the 1970s involving young foreign women being forced to work in the sex industry (see paragraph 83 above). The report further noted the significant increase in artistes coming from former Soviet countries following the collapse of the USSR (see paragraph 84 above). In her conclusions, the Ombudsman highlighted that trafficking was able to flourish in Cyprus due to the tolerance of the immigration authorities (see paragraph 89 above). In his 2006 report, the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights also noted that the authorities were aware that many of the women who entered Cyprus on artiste’s visas would work in prostitution (see paragraph 96 above). There can therefore be no doubt that the Cypriot authorities were aware that a substantial number of foreign women, particularly from the ex-USSR, were being trafficked to Cyprus on artistes visas and, upon arrival, were being sexually exploited by cabaret owners and managers.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">295.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Second, the Court emphasises that Ms Rantseva was taken by her employer to Limassol police station. Upon arrival at the police station, M.A. told the police that Ms Rantseva was a Russian national and was employed as a cabaret artiste. Further, he explained that she had only recently arrived in Cyprus, had left her employment without warning and had also moved out of the accommodation provided to her (see paragraph 19 above). He handed to them her passport and other documents (see paragraph 21 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">296.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court recalls the obligations undertaken by the Cypriot authorities in the context of the Palermo Protocol and, subsequently, the Anti-Trafficking Convention to ensure adequate training to those working in relevant fields to enable them to identify potential trafficking victims (see paragraphs 155 and 167 above). In particular, under Article 10 of the Palermo Protocol, States undertake to provide or strengthen training for law enforcement, immigration and other relevant officials in the prevention of trafficking in persons. In the Court’s opinion, there were sufficient indicators available to the police authorities, against the general backdrop of trafficking issues in Cyprus, for them to have been aware of circumstances giving rise to a credible suspicion that Ms Rantseva was, or was at real and immediate risk of being, a victim of trafficking or exploitation. Accordingly, a positive obligation arose to investigate without delay and to take any necessary operational measures to protect Ms Rantseva.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">297.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, in the present case, it appears that the police did not even question Ms Rantseva when she arrived at the police station. No statement was taken from her. The police made no further inquiries into the background facts. They simply checked whether Ms Rantseva’s name was on a list of persons wanted by the police and, on finding that it was not, called her employer and asked him to return and collect her. When he refused and insisted that she be detained, the police officer dealing with the case put M.A. in contact with his superior (see paragraph 20 above). The details of what was said during M.A.’s conversation with the officer’s superior are unknown, but the result of the conversation was that M.A. agreed to come and collect Ms Rantseva and subsequently did so.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">298.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the present case, the failures of the police authorities were multiple. First, they failed to make immediate further inquiries into whether Ms Rantseva had been trafficked. Second, they did not release her but decided to confide her to the custody of M.A.. Third, no attempt was made to comply with the provisions of Law 3(1) of 2000 and to take any of the measures in section 7 of that law (see paragraph 130 above) to protect her. The Court accordingly concludes that these deficiencies, in circumstances which gave rise to a credible suspicion that Ms Rantseva might have been trafficked or exploited, resulted in a failure by the Cypriot authorities to take measures to protect Ms Rantseva. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 4 in this respect also.</span></p><p class="sCA71A5BA"><span class="sA36B60A1">iii.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Procedural obligation to investigate trafficking</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">299.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">A further question arises as to whether there has been a procedural breach as a result of the continuing failure of the Cypriot authorities to conduct any effective investigation into the applicant’s allegations that his daughter was trafficked.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">300.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In light of the circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s subsequent death, the Court considers that the requirement incumbent on the Cypriot authorities to conduct an effective investigation into the trafficking allegations is subsumed by the general obligation arising under Article 2 in the present case to conduct an effective investigation into Ms Rantseva’s death (see paragraph 234 above). The question of the effectiveness of the investigation into her death has been considered above in the context of the Court’s examination of the applicant’s complaint under Article 2 and a violation has been found.

It is insufficient, in order for an obligation to take urgent operational measures to arise, merely to show that there was a general risk in respect of young women travelling to Cyprus on artistes’ visas.

In the case of Cyprus, as the Ombudsman pointed out in her report (see paragraph 86 above), the recruitment of victims is usually undertaken by artistic agents in Cyprus working with agents in other countries. The failure to investigate the recruitment aspect of alleged trafficking would allow an important part of the trafficking chain to act with impunity. In this regard, the Court highlights that the definition of trafficking adopted in both the Palermo Protocol and the Anti-Trafficking Convention expressly includes the recruitment of victims (see paragraphs 150 and 164 above). The need for a full and effective investigation covering all aspects of trafficking allegations from recruitment to exploitation is indisputable. The Russian authorities therefore had an obligation to investigate the possibility that individual agents or networks operating in Russia were involved in trafficking Ms</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rantseva to Cyprus.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">308.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, the Court observes that the Russian authorities undertook no investigation into how and where Ms Rantseva was recruited.

The recruitment having occurred on Russian territory, the Russian authorities were best placed to conduct an effective investigation into Ms Rantseva’s recruitment.

The difference between restrictions on movement serious enough to fall within the ambit of a deprivation of liberty under Article 5 § 1 and mere restrictions of liberty which are subject only to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 is one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Guzzardi v. Italy</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 6 November 1980, § 93, Series A no. 39). In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5, the starting point must be her concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Engel and Others v. the Netherlands</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 8 June 1976, §§ 58-59, Series A no. 22;</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> Guzzardi</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 92; and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Riera Blume and Others v.

There is no evidence that Ms Rantseva was informed of the reason for her detention; indeed, as the Court has noted above (see paragraph 297) there is no record that she was interviewed by the police at all during her time at the police station. Despite the fact that the police concluded that Ms Rantseva’s immigration status was not irregular and that there were no grounds for her continued detention, she was not immediately released. Instead, at the request of the person in charge of the Aliens and Immigration Service (“AIS”), the police telephoned M.A. and requested that he collect her and take her to the AIS office at 7 a.m. for further investigation. M.A. was advised that if he did not collect her, she would be allowed to leave. Ms Rantseva was detained at the police station until M.A.’s arrival, when she was released into his custody (see paragraph 20 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">316.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The facts surrounding Ms Rantseva’s subsequent stay in M.P.’s apartment are unclear. In his witness statement to the police, M.A. denied that Ms Rantseva was held in the apartment against her will and insists that she was free to leave (see paragraph 21 above). The applicant alleges that Ms Rantseva was locked in the bedroom and was thus forced to attempt an escape via the balcony.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes that Ms Rantseva died after falling from the balcony of the apartment in an apparent attempt to escape (see paragraph 41 above). It is reasonable to assume that had she been a guest in the apartment and was free to leave at any time, she would simply have left via the front door (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Storck v. Germany</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;61603/00&quot;]}" target="_blank">61603/00</a>, §§ 76-78, ECHR 2005</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">V). Accordingly, the Court considers that Ms Rantseva did not remain in the apartment of her own free will.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">317.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In all, the alleged detention lasted about two hours. Although of short duration, the Court emphasises the serious nature and consequences of the detention and recalls that where the facts indicate a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1, the relatively short duration of the detention does not affect this conclusion (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Järvinen v.

Ms Rantseva was not a minor. According to the evidence of the police officers on duty, she displayed no signs of drunkenness (see paragraph 20 above). It is insufficient for the Cypriot authorities to argue that there is no evidence that Ms Rantseva did not consent to leaving with M.A.: as the AIRE Centre pointed out (see paragraph 269 above), victims of trafficking often suffer severe physical and psychological consequences which render them too traumatised to present themselves as victims. Similarly, in her 2003 report the Ombudsman noted that fear of repercussions and inadequate protection measures resulted in a limited number of complaints being made by victims to the Cypriot police (see paragraphs 87 to 88 above).</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">321.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Taken in the context of the general living and working conditions of cabaret artistes in Cyprus, as well as in light of the particular circumstances of Ms Rantseva’s case, the Court considers that it is not open to the police to claim that they were acting in good faith and that they bore no responsibility for Ms Rantseva’s subsequent deprivation of liberty in M.P.’s apartment. It is clear that without the active cooperation of the Cypriot police in the present case, the deprivation of liberty could not have occurred. The Court therefore considers that the national authorities acquiesced in Ms Rantseva’s loss of liberty.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">3.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Compatibility of the deprivation of liberty with Article 5 § 1</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">322.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It remains to be determined whether the deprivation of liberty fell within one of the categories of permitted detention exhaustively listed in Article 5 § 1. The Court reiterates that Article 5 § 1 refers essentially to national law and lays down an obligation to comply with its substantive and procedural rules. It also requires, however, that any measure depriving the individual of his liberty must be compatible with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Riera Blume</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">,</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">cited above, § 31</span><span class="sA36B60A1">)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">323.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">By laying down that any deprivation of liberty should be “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, Article 5 § 1 requires, first, that any arrest or detention should have a legal basis in domestic law. The Cypriot Government did not point to any legal basis for the deprivation of liberty but it can be inferred that Ms Rantseva’s initial detention at the police station was effected in order to investigate whether she had failed to comply with immigration requirements. However, having ascertained that Ms Rantseva’s name was not included on the relevant list, no explanation has been provided by the Cypriot authorities as to the reasons and legal basis for the decision not to allow Ms Rantseva to leave the police station but to release her into the custody of M.A.. As noted above, the police found that Ms Rantseva did not exhibit signs of drunkenness and did not pose any threat to herself or others (see paragraphs 20 and 320 above). There is no indication, and it has not been suggested, that Ms Rantseva requested that M.A. come to collect her. The decision of the police authorities to detain Ms Rantseva until M.A.’s arrival and, subsequently, to consign her to his custody had no basis in domestic law.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">324.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It has not been argued that Ms Rantseva’s detention in the apartment was lawful.
