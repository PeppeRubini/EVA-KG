In her declarations to the Italian police, on 24</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">May 2003, the third applicant maintained that she, her husband and her daughter, who lived in Bulgaria in a condition of extreme precariousness, moved to Italy in search of work; when they arrived in Milan they approached an individual who spoke their language, X., who proposed to them to work as domestic employees to take care of his big house. The first applicant, in her declarations to the public prosecutor on 11 June 2003, maintained that she had met X. in “Yugoslavia”, where she was with her mother in search of a job, and from there X. had driven them to Italy in his car after proposing a job. They remained in the villa for several days, during which time they undertook household chores. After a while, X. declared to the second applicant that Y., his nephew, wanted to marry his daughter (the first applicant). As the second and third applicants refused, X. threatened them with a loaded gun. Then the second and third applicants were beaten, threatened with death and forced to leave the first applicant in Italy and go back to Bulgaria. Although the applicants denied this, it seems from their initial submissions that the second and third applicants had been offered money to leave their daughter behind. On 18 May 2003, the second and third applicants went back to Bulgaria. On their return the second applicant was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which he alleged was a consequence of the stress endured.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">9.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicants submitted that during the month (following 18</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">May</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">2003) spent at the villa in Ghislarengo, the first applicant was kept under constant surveillance and was forced to steal against her will, was beaten, threatened with death and repeatedly raped by Y. while tied to a bed. During one of the robberies in which the first applicant was forced to participate, she had an accident and had to be treated in hospital. However, the Serbian family refused to leave her there to undergo treatment. The applicants submitted that they were not aware of the name and location of this hospital.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">10.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 24 May 2003 the third applicant returned to Italy, accompanied by the first applicant’s sister</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">in</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">law (the fourth applicant), and lodged a complaint with the Italian police in Turin, reporting that she and her husband had been beaten and threatened and that the first applicant had been kidnapped. She further feared that her daughter might be led into prostitution. They were settled in a monastery near Turin. Subsequently, the police accompanied them with an interpreter to identify the house in Ghislarengo.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">11.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Apparently frustrated with the police’s slowness in responding to the complaint, the second applicant lodged written complaints with many other institutions. A letter of 31 May 2003, addressed to the Italian Prime Minister, the Italian Ministers for Foreign and Internal Affairs, the Italian Ambassador in Bulgaria, the Prefect of Turin, the Bulgarian Prime Minister, the Bulgarian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Bulgarian Ambassador to Italy, is included in the file.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">12.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It has been shown that, eighteen days after the lodging of the complaint,</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">on 11 June 2003, the police raided the house in Ghislarengo, found the first applicant there and made a number of arrests. At about 2 p.m. that day, she was taken to a police station in Vercelli and questioned, in the presence of an interpreter, by two female and two male police officers. The</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">applicants alleged that she was treated roughly and threatened that she would be accused of perjury and libel if she did not tell the truth. Allegedly she was then forced to declare that she did not wish her supposed kidnappers to be prosecuted, to answer “yes” to all other questions, and to sign certain documents in Italian, which she did not understand and which were neither translated into Bulgarian nor given to her. They also alleged that the interpreter did not do her job properly and remained silent in the face of the treatment being inflicted.</span><span class="s29100277"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicants further alleged that Y. was present during certain parts of the first applicant’s questioning.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">13.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Later that day, the third applicant was questioned by the police in Vercelli in the presence of an interpreter. The third applicant alleged that she was also threatened that she would be accused of perjury and libel if she did not tell the truth, and that the interpreter did not do her job properly. She</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">claimed that, as she refused to sign the record, the police treated her badly.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">14.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">At about 10 p.m. on the same day the first applicant was questioned again. The</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">applicants alleged that no interpreter or lawyer was present and that the first applicant was unaware of what was recorded. The first applicant was then taken to a cell and left there for four or five hours. On 12</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">June 2003 at about 4 a.m., she was transferred to a shelter for homeless persons, where she remained until 12.30 p.m.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">15.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On the same day, upon their request, the first, third and fourth applicants were taken by the police to the railway station in Vercelli and travelled back to Bulgaria.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">They submitted to the Court that the facts were then investigated by the Italian authorities, but that no criminal proceedings were instituted in Italy against the first applicant’s kidnappers, or at least that they were not informed, nor were they able to obtain information about any ongoing criminal investigation. They also complained that the Italian authorities did not seek to question the second applicant in order to establish the facts, by means of cooperation with the Bulgarian authorities.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">16.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It appears from the file that, after June 2003, the applicants sent several letters and e-mails, most of which were in Bulgarian, to the Italian authorities (such as the Italian Prime Minister, the Italian Ministers for Justice and Internal Affairs, the General Prosecutor attached to the Court of Appeal of Turin, the mayor of Ghislarengo and the Italian diplomatic authorities in Bulgaria), with a request to provide them with information about the police raid of 11 June 2003 and to start criminal proceedings against the first applicant’s alleged kidnappers. They also complained that they had suffered threats, humiliation and ill-treatment at the hands of the police. They asked those authorities to forward their complaints to the Public Prosecutor in Vercelli and to the police department of the same town.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">17.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">At the same time, the applicants also wrote to the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, the Head of the Consular Relations Division of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (CRD) and the Bulgarian Consulate in Rome, requesting them to protect their rights and assist them in obtaining information from the Italian authorities. The Bulgarian Consulate in Rome provided the applicants with certain information.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">18.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicants did not provide the Court with any document regarding their questioning and the subsequent criminal proceedings against them (see below). Their representative claimed that, considering the circumstances, including the alleged refusal of the Italian Embassy in Bulgaria, it was impossible to submit any document. Apart from copies of the letters sent to the Italian institutions, they only submitted two medical reports, one dated 22 June 2003 establishing that the first applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and one dated 24</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">June</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">2003 establishing that the first applicant had a bruise on the head, a small wound on the right elbow and a broken rib. It further stated that she had lost her virginity and was suffering from a vaginal infection. The medical report concluded that these injuries could have been inflicted in the way the first applicant had reported.</span></p><p class="s7EE1C8F0"><span class="s29100277">B.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The Italian Government’s version of the events</span></p><p class="s87F05BA2"><span class="sBB9EE52A">19.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 21 April 2009 and 30 July 2009, at the Court’s request, the Italian Government submitted a number of documents, among which the transcript of the first complaint lodged by the third applicant on 24</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">May</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">2003 with the Turin police, and the minutes of the interviews with the first applicant, the third applicant and some of the alleged kidnappers, which took place on 11 June 2003.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">20.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It appears from these documents that the transcript of the third applicant’s first complaint against the alleged kidnappers (lodged with the Italian police in Turin on 24 May 2003), as well as the applicants’ complaints sent by their representative to different Italian institutions, in the following days, were transmitted to the Italian police in Vercelli (on 26</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">May</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">and 6 June 2003 respectively) and to the Public Prosecutor of the same town (on 4 and 13 June 2003 respectively).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">21.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">More specifically, on 26 May 2003 the Turin Mobile Squad requested help from the Vercelli Mobile Squad to identify the location where the first applicant was allegedly being held. On 27 May 2003 the Vercelli Mobile Squad went to Ghislarengo to identify the location together with the third applicant. They inspected the location and the third applicant identified the villa she had mentioned in her complaint. On 4 June 2003 the Vercelli Police Headquarters transmitted the crime report (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">notizia di reato</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">) to the Vercelli Public Prosecutor’s Office. From the communal registry it appeared that no person resided in the identified villa, but that it was owned by an individual who had a criminal record. In consequence, the police kept the place under surveillance. The police raided the villa on 11 June 2003, after having observed movement inside. During the search the police seized a number of cameras containing photographs of what appeared to be a wedding.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">22.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 7, 11, 12 and 13 June 2003, the Ministry of Internal Affairs was informed by fax of developments in the case.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">23.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 11 June 2003 at about 2.30 p.m., immediately after the raid, the first applicant was questioned by the Public Prosecutor of Vercelli, who was assisted by the police. As also transpires from the documents, the first applicant made allegations that showed a number of discrepancies with the complaint previously submitted by her mother, and which led the authorities to conclude that no kidnapping, but rather an agreement about a marriage, had in reality taken place between the two families. This conclusion was confirmed by photographs given to the police by X. after the raid, showing a wedding party at which the second applicant received a sum of money from X. When showed the photographs, the first applicant denied that her father had taken money as part of the agreement about the marriage.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">24.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">At 8.30 p.m. the third applicant was questioned by the Public Prosecutor in Vercelli. She stated again that her daughter had not married Y. of her own free will, and claimed that the photographs were nothing but a fake, taken on purpose by the alleged kidnappers, who had threatened them with a gun, in order to undermine the credibility of their version of the facts. The Vercelli police also questioned X., Z. (a third party present at the wedding) and Y., who all stated that Y. had entered into a consensual marriage with the first applicant.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">25.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As a result of these interviews and on the basis of the photographs, the Public Prosecutor of Vercelli decided to turn the proceedings against unknown persons for kidnapping (1735/03 RGNR) into proceedings against the first and third applicants for perjury and libel. Later that evening, the first and third applicants were informed by the Vercelli and Turin police about the charges and invited to appoint a representative. They were then provided with a court-appointed lawyer. At about 11.30 p.m. the first applicant was transferred to a shelter for homeless people.

According to the police statements it could only be deduced that the daughter had been found at the villa and the persons who could have clarified the facts had availed themselves of the right to remain silent. The understanding of the facts was further complicated by the Roma tradition of selling, or paying a sum of money previously established to the family of the bride for the purposes of concluding a marriage, a matter which in the case of a dispute could have created consequences which it had been impossible to establish.</span></p><p class="s7EE1C8F0"><span class="s29100277">C.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The Bulgarian Government’s version of the events</span></p><p class="s87F05BA2"><span class="sBB9EE52A">33.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On the basis of the documents produced by the Italian Government, particularly the declarations made by X., Y. and Z., the Bulgarian Government considered the facts to be as follows.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 12 May 2003 the first three applicants arrived in Italy and were accommodated in the nomad camp in Arluno.

After festivities the newlyweds retired to the trailer where they consummated the marriage and Y. confirmed that the first applicant had been a virgin. The two families then went to the nomad camp of Kudzhiono where they celebrated the marriage. At the end of the wedding X. paid the second applicant the remainder of the amount due, namely EUR 10,500, in the presence of both families and other witnesses, as proven by the photographs.

In particular in respect of “exploitation”, in so far as relevant, it reads as follows:</span></p><p class="sA1CDB767"><span class="sBB9EE52A">85. The purpose must be exploitation of the individual. The Convention provides: “Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs”. National legislation may therefore target other forms of exploitation but must at least cover the types of exploitation mentioned as constituents of trafficking in human beings.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">86. The forms of exploitation specified in the definition cover sexual exploitation, labour exploitation and removal of organs, for criminal activity is increasingly diversifying in order to supply people for exploitation in any sector where demand emerges.</span></p><p class="s281358E1"><span class="sBB9EE52A">87. Under the definition, it is not necessary that someone have been exploited for there to be trafficking in human beings. It is enough that they have been subjected to one of the actions referred to in the definition and by one of the means specified “for the purpose of” exploitation. Trafficking in human beings is consequently present before the victim’s actual exploitation.</span></p><p class="sFD4D42B6"><span class="sBB9EE52A">88. As regards “the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation”, it should be noted that the Convention deals with these only in the context of trafficking in human beings. The terms “exploitation of the prostitution of others” and “other forms of sexual exploitation” are not defined in the Convention, which is therefore without prejudice to how states Parties deal with prostitution in domestic law.</span></p><p class="s8F4EE4B8"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The explanatory report continues to list the other types of exploitation, namely forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs and gives their definition according to the relevant international instruments and the ECHR case-law where available.</span></p><p class="s684F2214"><span class="s29100277">C.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Marriage</span></p><p class="s25BD2B45"><span class="sA36B60A1">1.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">55.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Following the General Assembly of the United Nations resolution 843 (IX) of 17 December 1954, declaring that certain customs, ancient laws and practices relating to marriage and the family were inconsistent with the principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and calling on states to develop and implement national legislation and policies prohibiting such practices, the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages was opened for signature and ratification by General Assembly resolution 1763 A (XVII) of 7 November 1962</span><a name="wp1033252" class="bookmark"></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">.

Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie – in that context, a certain weight will attach to the parent-child bond –, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. In these cases the essence of such a violation does not so much lie in the fact of the “disappearance” of the family member but rather concerns the authorities’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention.

One such example was the fact that X., Y. and Z.’s testimony did not correspond in respect of the venue where the alleged wedding celebrations had taken place. They also contended that any slight discrepancies in the first applicant’s testimony could only have been due to her anxiety as a result of the threats and ill-treatment she had been suffering. They further reiterated that the photos used as evidence had been obtained under threat and that the second applicant had been repeatedly beaten and forced at gun-point to pose in the said pictures. They also argued that the first applicant had been to discotheques and travelled in cars only within the ambit of the planning and actual robberies she was forced to participate in by the Serbian family.

Indeed, to date, the truth had not been established and various items of evidence had been disregarded. The minutes of the search of the villa were incomplete, the substantial amounts of money seized during the raid had not been described, and certain facts had not been examined, such as the finding of multiple passports in the same name. Neither had the investigation examined the first applicant’s claim that she had been repeatedly raped by Y. while having her hands and feet tied to the bed. Nor had any research been done to establish the criminal records of the Serbian family, whose only means of income were the recurring robberies they organised, or in relation to the events, namely the promise of work which had led the applicants to move to Italy.

The Government submitted that it took the authorities until 11 June 2003 to locate the villa where the first applicant was being held (since the third applicant had only provided a vague indication of the premises), to identify the occupants of the villa (no one officially resided there), to observe the happenings in the location and to make preparations for the necessary action leading to the arrest of the occupants and the release of the first applicant without casualties, as the third applicant had alleged that arms were held there.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">92.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The immediate investigation and arrest which ensued had shown a reality different from that announced by the third applicant in her initial complaint. It appeared that the first applicant had married Y. according to the customs and traditions of their ethnic group, for the price of EUR 11,000. This was evident from a number of photos which had been found at the venue, showing a wedding ceremony in which the first three applicants had participated and where, together with Y., they appeared contented and relaxed. Further photos showed the second applicant receiving money from Y.’s relatives. The conclusion that this consisted of a payment for the bride according to Roma customs and not a kidnapping was even more evident in the light of the numerous contradictions in the first and third applicants’ testimonies, together with the first applicant’s admission of a marriage contract. Moreover, no firearms were found during the raid, which disproved the third applicant’s allegation that they had been threatened by means of a firearm.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">93.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Italian Government submitted that this version of events had been considered truthful by the judgment of the Turin Investigating Magistrate of 26 January 2005. It had also been considered probable by the Turin Tribunal in its judgment of 8 February 2006, which according to the Government’s interpretation, concluded that the problem was mainly an economic disagreement in relation to the marriage contract concluded. It was very probable that the marriage contract had not been respected either because of an economic disagreement or because of the treatment of the first applicant following the marriage, which she had related to the third applicant over the phone. The Government reiterated that Roma marriages were specific, as had been accepted by the Court in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Muñoz Díaz v.

The scene of the events was isolated and preserved; relevant objects were identified and seized; the occupants of the premises were identified and arrested, and the first applicant was lodged in Caritas premises; the relevant actors and witnesses including the applicants were immediately heard and they were assisted by interpreters, lawyers and psychological experts. Having considered all the above, the judicial authorities had found it more likely that there had been a marriage contract. The Italian Government considered that in view of the evidence, it could not have been concluded otherwise. They further noted that it was not for the Court to establish the facts of the case, unless this was inevitable given the special circumstances, which was not so in the present case. Indeed, as had been proved by the Government, the official investigation had been carried out in depth, as shown by its detailed conclusions.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">95.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Italian Government submitted that in the eighteen days between 24 May and 11 June 2003 the third applicant had the status of a witness and had access to the information collected during the investigation to a degree which sufficed to allow her an effective participation in the procedure. From 11 June 2003 onwards the first and third applicants had the status of accused, in relation to which the invoked provisions had no bearing.</span></p><p class="sB6F98828"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Court’s assessment</span></p><p class="s360DA689"><span class="s29100277">(a)</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Admissibility</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">96.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes that it is confronted with a dispute over the exact nature of the alleged events.

In these circumstances, the Court considers that the third applicant’s testimony and the seriousness of the allegations made in the complaint lodged on 24 May 2003 raised a reasonable suspicion that the first applicant could have been subjected to ill-treatment as alleged.

It does not appear that any other efforts were made to question any third parties who could have witnessed the events at issue. Indeed, the Italian authorities considered that the photos collected at the venue corroborated the alleged assailants’ version of events. However, none of the other people in the photos was ever identified or questioned, a step which the Court considers was essential, given that the applicants maintained that they had been forced at gun-point to pose for such photos. Nor were any attempts made to hear the second applicant, who had been a major actor in the events at issue. Indeed, the Court notes that on the same day that the first applicant was released and heard, the criminal proceedings which had been instituted against the assailants were turned into criminal proceedings against the first and third applicants (see paragraph 25 above). The Court is struck by the fact that following the first applicant’s release it took the authorities less than a full day to reach their conclusions. In this light it stood to reason that the Turin Criminal Court considered it impossible to establish the facts clearly (see paragraph 32 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">105.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court also notes that, when released, the first applicant was not subject to a medical examination, notwithstanding the claims that she had been repeatedly beaten and raped. The Court further notes that even assuming that it was true that the events at issue amounted to a marriage in accordance with the Roma traditions, it was still alleged that in the month the first applicant stayed in Ghislarengo she had been beaten and forced to have sexual intercourse with Y. The Court notes that State authorities must take protective measures in the form of effective deterrence against serious breaches of an individual’s personal integrity also by a husband (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Opuz</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">v.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Turkey</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;33401/02&quot;]}" target="_blank">33401/02</a>, §§ 160-176, 9 June 2009) or partner. It follows that any such allegation should also have required an investigation. However, no particular questioning took place in this respect, nor was any other test undertaken, whether strictly medical or merely scientific. It is of even greater concern that the first applicant was a minor at the time of the events at issue. Indeed, the Convention requires effective deterrence against grave acts such as rape, and children and other vulnerable individuals, in particular, are entitled to effective protection (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">M.C.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">v.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Bulgaria</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">,</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;39272/98&quot;]}" target="_blank">39272/98</a>, § 150, ECHR 2003</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">XII).

While this has not been established, the Court cannot exclude that the circumstances of the present case, as reported by the first applicant to the Italian authorities (see paragraph 8 above), had they been proved, could have amounted to human trafficking as defined in international conventions (see Relevant International Texts above), which undoubtedly also amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment under Article 3 of the Convention. In consequence, the Italian authorities had an obligation to look into the matter and to establish all the relevant facts by means of an appropriate investigation which required that this aspect of the complaint be also examined and scrutinized. This was not so, the Italian authorities having opined that the circumstances of the present case fell within the context of a Roma marriage. The Court cannot share the view that such a conclusion sufficed to remove any doubt that the circumstances of the case revealed an instance of human trafficking which required a particularly thorough investigation </span><span class="sA36B60A1">inter alia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> because a possible “Roma marriage” cannot be used as a reason not to investigate in the circumstances. Furthermore, the Court observes that the rapid decision of the Italian authorities not to proceed to a thorough investigation had, among other things, the consequence that medical evidence on the physical condition of the first applicant was not even sought.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">107.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In conclusion, the Court considers that the above elements suffice to demonstrate that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the investigation into the first applicant’s alleged ill-treatment by private individuals was not effective under Article 3 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">108.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">There has therefore been a procedural violation of Article 3.</span></p><p class="s684F2214"><span class="s29100277">B.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The complaint regarding the second and third applicant’s ill-treatment at the hands of the Roma family and the lack of an effective investigation by the Italian authorities in this respect</span></p><p class="s25BD2B45"><span class="sA36B60A1">1.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The parties’ observations</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">109.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicants complained that the second and third applicants had also suffered ill-treatment and threats at the hands of the Serbian family. In particular, the second applicant had been repeatedly beaten and forced at gun-point to pose in the “wedding” pictures. However, the Italian authorities took no steps to question the second applicant as a victim of ill-treatment and threats, as a result of which they claimed he had been declared 100% invalid by the Vidin Medical Commission on 5 October 2010 (the applicants acknowledged that they had not submitted documents in proof of this). As a result of the stress and anxiety caused, the second applicant had been diagnosed with diabetes shortly after the events at issue.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">110.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Italian Government submitted that criminal investigations in respect of threats against and injuries to the second and third applicants had been initiated immediately following the third applicant’s oral complaints to the police of Turin on 24 May 2003. However, it had not resulted from the investigation that their complaints were truthful. According to the Government, it was strange that the second and third applicants claimed to have been beaten on 18 May 2003 and yet they decided to go back to Bulgaria. Furthermore, no medical documents substantiating this claim had been submitted and no firearms had been found during the raid at the villa, which disproved the allegation that they had been threatened at gun-point.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Court’s assessment</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">111.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">According to the Court’s case-law, allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate </span><a name="HIT23" class="bookmark"></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">evidence.

However, they did not provide the authorities with any form of medical report to accompany the complaint lodged by the third applicant on 24 May 2003. Moreover, to date, no evidence has been submitted to the Court indicating that the second and third applicants could have been subjected to ill-treatment at the hands of the Serbian family. In this light, the Court considers that there is no sufficient, consistent or reliable evidence to establish to the necessary degree of proof that they were subjected to such ill-treatment.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">113.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In consequence, the authorities were not given a reasonable cause for suspecting that the second and third applicants had been subjected to improper treatment, which would have required a fully fledged investigation.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">114.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It follows that the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">35 §§</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">3 and</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s7EE1C8F0"><span class="s29100277">C.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The complaint regarding the first and third applicants’ ill-treatment at the hands of the police officers during their questioning</span></p><p class="s87F05BA2"><span class="sBB9EE52A">115.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The first and third applicants complained about ill-treatment during their interrogation, namely that they were not provided with lawyers and interpreters during that time and that they were forced to sign documents the content of which they had not understood. They further complained about the criminal proceedings with which they were threatened and which were eventually instituted against them, noting that they had only been taken up in order for the authorities to apply pressure on them. They also contended that subsequently the court-appointed lawyer failed to safeguard their interests during the questioning, notably by failing to request that the Serbian family be kept outside the room, by not ensuring adequate interpreters and treatment without threats and most gravely by allowing the first applicant to be kept in a cell for hours following her questioning.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">116.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court firstly notes that the first and third applicants failed to press charges against any alleged offenders from the police force. No official complaint has ever been lodged with the Italian authorities in respect of this alleged ill-treatment. Neither has it been submitted that they attempted to make such a complaint in the context of the proceedings eventually instituted against them. It follows that the first and third applicants failed to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of this complaint.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">117.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, the Court notes that the treatment described by the applicants does not attain the minimum level of severity to make it fall within the scope of Article 3. In particular, the Court considers that the fact that the first and third applicants were warned about the possibility of being prosecuted and imprisoned if they did not tell the truth may be considered to be part of the normal duties of the authorities when questioning an individual, and not an unlawful threat. Moreover, according to the documents submitted by the Italian Government, an interpreter or a lawyer or both accompanied the first and third applicants during the different stages of the interrogation.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">118.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">For these reasons, this complaint must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention</span></p><p class="s684F2214"><span class="s29100277">D.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The complaint regarding the lack of action and an effective investigation into the alleged events against Bulgaria</span></p><p class="s25BD2B45"><span class="sA36B60A1">1.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The parties’ observations</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">119.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In respect of Bulgaria, the applicants complained about the delay in the treatment of the second applicant’s complaint of 31 May 2003 by the consular authorities. It took the authorities two days to take action in respect of the complaint, following the applicants’ representative’s aggressive criticisms. They contended that the Bulgarian Government had failed to explain in what way the CRD had assisted the applicants in their interests as required by Article 32 of the Regulations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Indeed, they had not interfered in the choice of interpreters (who remained silent in the face of the treatment suffered by the two applicants during interrogation) or the court-appointed lawyer, nor had a consular representative been present during the questioning.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">120.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Similarly, no information had been submitted and nothing had been done by the Bulgarian authorities to repatriate the applicants and the National agency for the protection of infants had not been informed in order for it to be able to take the necessary measures. Neither had the Ministry or the Embassy of Bulgaria in Rome informed the Prosecutor’s Office in Bulgaria, which could have undertaken proceedings against the Serbian family. Moreover, the Bulgarian authorities had not informed the Italian authorities that according to Bulgarian law a marriage of a minor Bulgarian national, celebrated abroad, required the prior authorisation of the Bulgarian diplomatic or consular representative (Articles 12, 13 and 131 of the Bulgarian Family Code). In the present case no such request was made or granted. This requirement was valid for all Bulgarian citizens irrespective of their ethnicity and in any case ethnic traditions could not set aside the law.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">121.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Bulgarian Government contended that in the absence of any specific allegation of any treatment contrary to Article 3 there could not be a violation of that provision. Moreover, any positive obligations on their part could only arise in respect of actions committed or ongoing in Bulgarian territory.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">122.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Without prejudice to the above, the Bulgarian Government submitted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the CRD, the Ambassador and the Consul in Rome immediately reacted when notified of the case. They established contact with the Italian authorities and specified that the alleged victim was a minor and was being held against her will. The Bulgarian Ambassador maintained constant communication with the Italian authorities and transferred the information to the second applicant, who had expressed his gratitude in this respect. The fact that adequate and comprehensive measures had been taken by the Bulgarian CRD was also evident from the consular file in relation to the case, which was submitted to the Court. That file contained more than a hundred pages and, on 2</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">June</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">2003, it had been sent to the Embassy of Bulgaria in Rome with the instruction to take immediate action in cooperation with the Italian authorities for the release of the first applicant and her return to Bulgaria.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">123.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The second applicant again solicited the Bulgarian authorities on 11</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">June 2003 and the CRD again referred to the Embassy of Bulgaria in Rome on the same day. In turn the Embassy replied that the provincial unit of the carabinieri in Turin and the central management of the Vercelli Police had conducted a successful action to release the first applicant from the house; she was found to be in good condition and was under the protection of the public authorities. This information was immediately forwarded to the second applicant. By a letter dated 24 June 2003 the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome notified the CRD that, following a request by the second applicant, information had been received from the Head Office of the Criminal Police of Italy to the effect that the result of the inquiry and declaration of the first applicant indicated that her father had received money for a forthcoming wedding and therefore there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings against the Serbian family. They further noted that the judicial authorities were considering the possibility of bringing proceedings against the first and third applicants for libel and perjury. The second applicant was informed of this by a letter of 1 July 2003. Subsequently correspondence was maintained between the Consular Section and the applicants and their representative, as well as with the Italian authorities. Thus, within their competence, the Bulgarian authorities had been fully cooperative.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Court’s assessment</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">124.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court reiterates that the engagement undertaken by a Contracting State under Article 1 of the Convention is confined to “securing” (“</span><span class="sA36B60A1">reconnaître</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">” in the French text) the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own “jurisdiction” (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Soering v. the </span><a name="HIT86" class="bookmark"></a><span class="sA36B60A1">United </span><a name="HIT87" class="bookmark"></a><span class="sA36B60A1">Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 7 July 1989, § 86, Series A no. 161).

Accordingly, since it could not be shown that there were special features in that case which required a departure from the general approach, the obligation to ensure an effective official investigation applied to Cyprus alone. Notwithstanding that Ms Rantseva was a Russian national, the Court concluded that there was no free-standing obligation incumbent on the Russian authorities under Article 2 of the Convention to investigate.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">126.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It follows from the above that in the circumstances of the present case, where the alleged ill-treatment occurred on Italian territory and where the Court has already found that it was for the Italian authorities to investigate the events, there cannot be said to have been an obligation on the part of the Bulgarian authorities to carry out an investigation under Article 3 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">127.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Moreover, the Convention organs have repeatedly stated that the Convention does not contain a right which requires a High Contracting Party to exercise diplomatic protection, or espouse an applicant’s complaints under international law or otherwise to intervene with the authorities of another State on his or her behalf (see for example, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Kapas v</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;12822/87&quot;]}" target="_blank">12822/87</a>, Commission decision of 9 December 1987, Decision and Reports (DR) 54, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">L. v Sweden,</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;12920/87&quot;]}" target="_blank">12920/87</a>, Commission decision of 13 December 1988, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Dobberstein v Germany</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;25045/94&quot;]}" target="_blank">25045/94</a>, Commission decision of 12 April 1996 and the decisions cited therein).</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Nevertheless, the Court notes that the Bulgarian authorities repeatedly pressed for action by the Italian authorities, as explained by the Bulgarian Government in their submissions and as shown from the documents submitted to the Court.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">128.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In conclusion, the Court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">35 §§</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">3 and</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s9F223FEE"><span class="sBB9EE52A">III.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 4 OF THE CONVENTION</span></p><p class="s507703F"><span class="sBB9EE52A">129.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicants contended that the treatment the first applicant had suffered at the hands of the Serbian family and the fact that she was forced to take part in organised crime constituted a violation of Article 4.

Moreover, the applicants failed to understand how the authorities considered that Roma traditions, which clearly amounted to a violation of the criminal law (see sections 177-78 and 190-91 of the Bulgarian Criminal Code, relevant domestic law above), could be overlooked and considered normal.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">131.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In respect of their complaint against Italy they reiterated their submissions put forward under Article 3.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">132.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In respect of Bulgaria, the applicants also reiterated their submissions under Article 3. They further noted that even though in Bulgaria a law against human trafficking had been enacted, in practice this had no effect. In fact, the Bulgarian Government had not been able to submit any statistics as to the number of people having been prosecuted under the Criminal Code provisions in this respect. As to prevention, the applicants contended that the Bulgarian Government should have been able to spot the dangers a family like the applicants would have faced when deciding to move to Italy following a suspicious promise of work. They insisted that no relevant questions had been set to the applicants at the border as though a risk for trafficking could have never existed.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Italian Government</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">133.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Italian Government submitted that in the third applicant’s complaint to the Turin Police of 24 May 2003 there had been no allegation of forced labour of human trafficking, but only a fear that the first applicant could be forced into prostitution.</span><span class="sE208486F"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">They considered that the Trafficking Convention could not come to play in the circumstances of the case as established by the domestic courts.

The Government reiterated that the present case did not concern trafficking in human beings, as the facts did not fall under the definition of trafficking according to Article 4 of the Trafficking Convention. As confirmed by the excerpt of the border police (submitted to the Court) the applicants freely and voluntarily established themselves in Italy according to their right of freedom of movement. The first applicant, although a minor, left the borders of Bulgaria and arrived and resided in Italy with her parents, voluntarily and with their consent. The departure from Bulgarian territory was lawful and the authorities had no reason to prohibit it, allowing such a move according to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention and European Union legislation. Moreover, there had been no evidence of trafficking in human beings on Bulgarian territory, an issue not alleged by the applicants. Indeed, the applicants, alone or through their representative, had not notified any of the Bulgarian institutions in charge of trafficking. Any allegations in this respect could be communicated to the State Agency for Child Protection, the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking and the Council of Ministers, the Prosecution of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Ministry of Interior which had specific powers under the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure to deal with such allegations.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">137.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">They submitted that the present case regarded a personal relationship of a private legal nature in terms of the voluntary involvement in marriage and the related rituals in accordance with the particular ethnicity of the applicants. According to the investigation, the first applicant freely married Y. in accordance with their traditions. The accepted and practiced model of Roma marriages provided for early and ubiquitous marriages. Marriage age was governed by custom according to the group to which the persons belonged, and in practice was generally a young age. Roma marriages were considered concluded with a wedding in the presence of the community and it did not require a civil or religious procedure to be considered sacred and indissoluble. The traditional Roma marriage consisted of two phases. The first, the engagement, regulated the pre-requisites of marriage such as the fixing of the bride’s “price”/“ransom”/”dowry”, which is a bargaining made by the fathers in view of the fact that the bride will then be part of the family of the groom. The second is the wedding, which includes a set of rituals, the most important of which was the consummation of the marriage, bearing in mind that virginity was a pre-requisite to the marriage. The Bulgarian Government submitted that from the testimony of X. Y. and Z., as drawn up by the Italian Urgent Action Squad, the wedding ritual of the applicant to Y. conformed to this traditional practice.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">138.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Moreover, it had not been established that there had been any debasing or degrading attitudes or instances of forced labour. The Government submitted that in her testimony of 11 June 2003, the first applicant declared to have married Y. and did not claim that she was dissatisfied with her marriage or that herself or her parents had been ill-treated or forced to work. Thus, according to the Government, the facts of the case regarded a regular consummation of a marriage and the undertaking of usual household chores, which could not amount to treatment prohibited under Article 4, particularly since the first applicant admitted to having freely moved to Italy, travelled by car and attended discotheques.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">139.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government considered that when the Bulgarian Consular Section signalled a coercive holding of a minor-aged female, the Italian authorities gave full assistance and carried out an effective investigation, but after having established the above-mentioned facts, could not conclude that the case concerned trafficking in human beings. They noted that the Italian authorities “freed” the first applicant who was found to be in a good health and mental condition. She was questioned by staff specialised in interaction with minors and had access to an interpreter. Moreover, the authorities provided support to her and her relatives, including accommodation and payment of costs. The Italian authorities took all the relevant witness testimony and other measures to establish the facts and the applicants had ample opportunity to participate as witnesses in the investigation, throughout which they were provided with an interpreter. Thus, the relatives had also been directly involved in the investigation. Therefore, the criteria for an effective investigation according to the Court’s case-law (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">v.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Cyprus and Russia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;25965/04&quot;]}" target="_blank">25965/04</a>, § 233, 7 January 2010) had been fulfilled.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">140.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the steps taken by the Bulgarian authorities, the Bulgarian Government reiterated their submissions under Article 3 (see paragraphs 121-123 above). Indeed both the Bulgarian and Italian authorities had reacted promptly. It followed that the actions of both States had been in accordance with Convention obligations (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 289).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">141.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">They further submitted that in so far as the case could be considered under Article 4 the Bulgarian authorities had fulfilled their positive obligations in an adequate and timely manner. The Bulgarian Government noted that the Trafficking Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria in 2007 and therefore was not applicable at the time of the events in the present case. However, the Government submitted that Bulgaria had fulfilled its positive obligation and taken the necessary measures to establish a workable and effective legislation on the criminalisation of human trafficking.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">142.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">They had further put in place an appropriate legislative and administrative framework. They noted that by 2003 the following legislation was applicable, in connection with the prevention, combating and criminalisation of trafficking:</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">- The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, adopted on 15 November 2000, ratified by Bulgaria in 2001</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">- The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in persons, Especially Women and Children of 15 November 2000</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">- Recommendation No. R (85) 11 to the Member States on the position of the victim in the framework of criminal law and procedure, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 28 June 1985</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">- Recommendation 1545 (2002) on the campaign against trafficking in women of January 21, 2002</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">- Council Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration and who cooperate with the competent authorities.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">- European Parliament resolutions related to exploitation of prostitution and trafficking in people.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Moreover, by means of amendments to the Criminal Code in 2002, human trafficking had been criminalised (see Relevant domestic law) and in 2003 a specific law on combating human trafficking establishing effective counter-action leverage was passed by parliament. Public information was also provided by the national media on the risks of trafficking in persons. Thus, the Bulgarian Government took all feasible positive measures on the creation of an effective domestic system for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of such offences. Moreover, the applicants had made no complaint in respect of this framework.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">143.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Bulgarian Government also submitted that they had fulfilled their positive obligation to take protective measures. They submitted that there was no evidence that they had been particularly notified about any particular circumstances which could give rise to a justified and reasonable suspicion of a real and immediate risk to the first applicant before she left to Italy and later during her stay there. In consequence there had not been a positive obligation to take preliminary steps to protect her.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">144.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to a procedural obligation to investigate potential trafficking, the Government reiterated that the applicants actions were voluntary, this notwithstanding that the Bulgarian and Italian joint efforts led to the desired result of the first applicant being released and returned to Bulgaria.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">145.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the forensic expertise presented, the Government noted that this could not be considered as valid evidence as it had not been produced according to the law, it having been compiled one month after the first applicant’s return to Bulgaria and not immediately at the time of the alleged events.</span></p><p class="s684F2214"><span class="s29100277">B.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The Court’s assessment</span></p><p class="s25BD2B45"><span class="sA36B60A1">1.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Application of Article 4 of the Convention</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">146.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court has never considered the provisions of the Convention as the sole framework of reference for the interpretation of the rights and freedoms enshrined therein (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Demir and Baykara v.

It has long stated that one of the main principles of the application of the Convention provisions is that it does not apply them in a vacuum (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Loizidou v.

The Court must have regard to the fact that the context of the provision is a treaty for the effective protection of individual human rights and that the Convention must be read as a whole, and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (dec.)

France</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;73316/01&quot;]}" target="_blank">73316/01</a>, § 122, ECHR 2005</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">VII). With regard to the concept of “servitude”, the Court has held that what is prohibited is a “particularly serious form of denial of freedom” (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Van</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Droogenbroeck v.

The concept of “servitude” entails an obligation, under coercion, to provide one’s services, and is linked with the concept of “slavery” (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Seguin v.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">France</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (dec.), no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"><a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;42400/98&quot;]}" target="_blank">42400/98</a>, 7 March 2000; and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">124). For “forced or compulsory labour” to arise, the Court has held that there must be some physical or mental constraint, as well as some overriding of the person’s will (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Van der Mussele v.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Belgium</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 23 November 1983, § 34, Series A no. 70; </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 117).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">150.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court is not regularly called upon to consider the application of Article 4 and, in particular, has had only two occasions to date to consider the extent to which treatment associated with trafficking fell within the scope of that Article (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, both cited above). In the former case, the Court concluded that the treatment suffered by the applicant amounted to servitude and forced and compulsory labour, although it fell short of slavery. In the latter case, trafficking itself was considered to run counter to the spirit and purpose of Article 4 of the Convention such as to fall within the scope of the guarantees offered by that Article without the need to assess which of the three types of proscribed conduct was engaged by the particular treatment in the case in question.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">151.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, the Court considered that trafficking in human beings, by its very nature and aim of exploitation, is based on the exercise of powers attaching to the right of ownership. It treats human beings as commodities to be bought and sold and put to forced labour, often for little or no payment, usually in the sex industry but also elsewhere. It implies close surveillance of the activities of victims, whose movements are often circumscribed. It involves the use of violence and threats against victims, who live and work under poor conditions. It is described in the explanatory report accompanying the Anti-Trafficking Convention as the modern form of the old worldwide slave trade. In those circumstances, the Court concluded that trafficking itself, within the meaning of Article 3(a) of the Palermo Protocol and Article 4(a) of the Anti-Trafficking Convention, fell within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 281-282).</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Application to the present case</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">152.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court once again highlights that it is confronted with a dispute over the exact nature of the alleged events. The parties to the case have presented diverging factual circumstances and regrettably the lack of investigation by the Italian authorities has led to little evidence being available to determine the case. Having said that, the Court cannot but take its decisions on the basis of the evidence submitted by the parties.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">153.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this light, in so far as an objection </span><span class="sA36B60A1">ratione materiae</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> can be inferred from the Governments’ submissions the Court considers that it is not necessary to deal with this objection since it considers that the complaint, in its various branches, is in any event inadmissible for the following reasons.</span></p><p class="s6EF3B654"><span class="s29100277">(a)</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The complaint against Italy</span></p><p class="s8C50CFA1"><span class="sA36B60A1">1.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The circumstances as alleged by the applicants</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">154.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court has already held above that the circumstances as alleged by the applicants could have amounted to human trafficking. However, it considers that from the evidence submitted there is not sufficient ground to establish the veracity of the applicants’ version of events, namely that the first applicant was transferred to Italy in order to serve as a pawn in some kind of racket devoted to illegal activities. In consequence, the Court does not recognise the existence of circumstances capable of amounting to the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons for the purpose of exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. It follows that the applicants’ allegation that there had been an instance of actual human trafficking has not been proved and therefore cannot be accepted by the Court.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">155.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Since it has not been established that the first applicant was a victim of trafficking, the Court considers that the obligations under Article 4 to penalise and prosecute trafficking in the ambit of a proper legal or regulatory framework cannot come into play in the instant case.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">156.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the Article 4 obligation on the authorities to take appropriate measures within the scope of their powers to remove the individual from that situation or risk, the Court notes that irrespective of whether or not there existed a credible suspicion that there was a real or immediate risk that the first applicant was being trafficked or exploited, the Court has already found under Article 3 of the Convention that the Italian authorities had taken all the required steps to free the applicant from the situation she was in (see paragraph 103 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">157.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In so far as Article 4 also provides for a procedural obligation to investigate situations of potential trafficking, the Court has already found in its assessment under the procedural aspect of Article 3 above (see paragraphs 107-108 above) that the Italian authorities failed to undertake an effective investigation into the circumstances of the present case.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">158.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In consequence the Court does not find it necessary to examine this limb of the complaint.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">159.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Given the above, the Court considers that the overall complaint under Article 4 against Italy based on the applicant’s version of events is inadmissible, as manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="sCA71A5BA"><span class="sA36B60A1">ii.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The circumstances as established by the authorities</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">160.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes that the authorities concluded that the facts of the case amounted to a typical marriage according to the Roma tradition. The first applicant, who was aged seventeen years and nine months at the time of the alleged marriage, never denied that she willingly married Y. She did, however, deny that any payment had been made to her father for the marriage. Nevertheless, the photos collected by the police appear to suggest that an exchange of money in fact took place. Little has been established in respect of any ensuing treatment within the household.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">161.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court therefore considers that in relation to the events as established by the authorities, again, there is not sufficient evidence indicating that the first applicant was held in slavery. Even assuming that the applicant’s father received a sum of money in respect of the alleged marriage, the Court is of the view that, in the circumstances of the present case, such a monetary contribution cannot be considered to amount to a price attached to the transfer of ownership, which would bring into play the concept of slavery. The Court reiterates that marriage has deep-rooted social and cultural connotations which may differ largely from one society to another (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Schalk and Kopf v. Austria</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;30141/04&quot;]}" target="_blank">30141/04</a>, § 62, ECHR 2010). According to the Court, this payment can reasonably be accepted as representing a gift from one family to another, a tradition common to many different cultures in today’s society.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">162.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Neither is there any evidence indicating that the first applicant was subjected to “servitude” or “forced or compulsory” labour, the former entailing coercion to provide one’s services (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above § 124) and the latter bringing to mind the idea of physical or mental constraint. What there has to be is work “exacted ... under the menace of any penalty” and also performed against the will of the person concerned, that is work for which he or she “has not offered himself or herself voluntarily” (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Van</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">der Mussele</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 34, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above § 117). The court observes that despite the first applicant’s testimony claiming that she was forced to work, the third applicant explained in her complaint of 24</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">May 2003 that her family had been employed to do housework.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">163.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, according to the Court the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">post facto</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> medical records submitted are not sufficient to determine beyond reasonable doubt that the first applicant actually suffered some form of ill-treatment or exploitation as understood in the definition of trafficking. Neither can the Court consider that the sole payment of a sum of money suffices to consider that there had been trafficking in human beings. Nor is there evidence suggesting that such a union was contracted for the purposes of exploitation, be it sexual or other. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the union was undertaken for purposes other than those generally associated with a traditional marriage.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">164.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes with interest the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe’s resolutions (see Relevant international texts above) showing concern in respect of Roma women in the context of forced and child marriages (the latter defined as the union of two persons at least one of whom is under 18 years of age) and it shares these apprehensions. The Court, however, notes that the resolutions airing such concerns and encouraging action in this respect are dated 2005 and 2010 and therefore at the time of the alleged events not only was there not any binding instrument, as remains the case to date, but in actual fact there was not enough awareness and consensus among the international community to condemn such actions. The prevailing document at the time (which was not ratified by Italy or Bulgaria) was the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages (1962) which determined that it was for the States to decide on an age limit for contracting marriage and allowed a dispensation as to age to be given by a competent authority in exceptional circumstances. This trend is reflected in the legislation of many of the member States of the Council of Europe which consider eighteen years to be the age of consent for the purposes of marriage, and provide for exceptional circumstances whereby a court or other authority (often on consulting the guardians) may allow a marriage to be contracted by a person who is younger (for example, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Hungary, Malta, San Marino, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden), the most common being at least sixteen years of age.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">165.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes that in 2003, when the first applicant appears to have undertaken this union, she was a few months away from adulthood. Indeed under Italian legislation, it is perfectly legal for a person aged sixteen or more to have consensual sexual intercourse (see by implication article 609 quarter in paragraph 40 above), even without the consent of the parent, and he or she may also leave the family home with the consent of the parents. Moreover, in the instant case there is not sufficient evidence indicating that the union was forced on the first applicant who had not testified that she had not consented to it and who emphasized that Y. had not forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. In this light it cannot be said that the circumstances as established by the authorities raise any issue under Article 4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">166.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Accordingly, this part of the complaint under this provision, against Italy, is inadmissible </span><a name="HIT13" class="bookmark"></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">as being manifestly ill-founded</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">and must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s8378218E"><span class="s29100277">(b)</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The complaint against Bulgaria</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">167.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes that had any alleged trafficking commenced in Bulgaria it would not be outside the Court’s competence to examine whether Bulgaria complied with any obligation it may have had to take measures within the limits of its own jurisdiction and powers to protect the first applicant from trafficking and to investigate the possibility that she had been trafficked (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above § 207). In addition, member States are also subject to a duty in cross-border trafficking cases to cooperate effectively with the relevant authorities of other States concerned in the investigation of events which occurred outside their territories (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 289).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">168.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, whether the matters complained of give rise to the Bulgarian’s State responsibility in the circumstances of the present case is a question which falls to be determined by the Court according to its examination of the merits of the complaint.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">169.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court has already established, above, that in respect of both the version of the events, the circumstances of the case did not give rise to human trafficking, a situation which would have engaged the responsibility of the Bulgarian State, had any trafficking commenced there.

They noted that the database of the Ministry of Foreign affairs did not store data in relation to ethnicity. Thus, there could be no allegation that the applicants had been subjected to discriminatory attitudes due to their ethnic origin. Moreover, they noted that the family accused by the applicants of such treatment was of the same ethnicity, which in itself dispelled any ideas of a difference in treatment.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">175.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court’s case-law on Article 14 establishes that discrimination means treating differently, without an objective and reasonable justification, persons in relevantly similar situations (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Willis v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"><a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;36042/97&quot;]}" target="_blank">36042/97</a>, § 48, ECHR 2002-IV). Racial violence is a particular affront to human dignity and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism and racist violence, thereby reinforcing democracy’s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of its enrichment.

Treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be turning a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention. Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State’s obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use its best endeavours and is not absolute; the authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances of the case (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Nachova and others</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">,</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">cited above, § 160).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">177.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Faced with the applicants’ complaint under Article 14, the Court’s task is to establish first of all whether or not racism was a causal factor in the circumstances leading to their complaint to the authorities and in relation to this, whether or not the respondent State complied with its obligation to investigate possible racist motives. Moreover, the Court should also examine whether in carrying out the investigation into the applicants’ allegation of ill-treatment by the police, the domestic authorities discriminated against the applicants and, if so, whether the discrimination was based on their ethnic origin.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">178.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the first limb of the complaint, the Court notes that even assuming the applicants’ version of events was truthful, the treatment they claim to have suffered at the hands of third parties cannot be said in any way to have racist overtones or that it was instigated by ethnic hatred or prejudice because the alleged perpetrators belonged to the same ethnic group as the applicants. Indeed, the applicants did not make this allegation to the police when they complained about the events related to the Serbian family. It follows that there was no positive obligation on the State to investigate such motives.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">179.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the second limb, namely whether the domestic authorities discriminated against the applicants on the basis of their ethnic origin, the Court notes that while it has already held above that the Italian authorities failed to adequately investigate the applicants’ allegations, from the documents submitted, it does not transpire that such failure to act was a consequence of discriminatory attitudes. Indeed, there appears to be no racist verbal abuse by the police during the investigation, nor were any tendentious remarks made by the prosecutor in relation to the applicants’ Roma origin throughout the investigation or by the courts in the subsequent trials. Moreover, the applicants did not accuse the authorities of displaying anti-Roma sentiment at the relevant time.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">180.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Accordingly, in so far as the complaint is directed against Italy, it is manifestly ill-founded, and is to be rejected according to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">181.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court considers that no such complaint has been directed against Bulgaria, and even if it were, the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and is to be rejected according to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s9F223FEE"><span class="sBB9EE52A">IV.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION</span></p><p class="s87F05BA2"><span class="sBB9EE52A">182.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Lastly, the applicants complained that the first and third applicants were not provided with lawyers and interpreters during their questioning, were not informed in what capacity they were being questioned, and were forced to sign documents the content of which they were unaware.

These complaints involved ill-treatment and non-consensual sexual acts with a minor, which allegedly lasted one month and took place in a villa owned by a person with a criminal record. The Court was unanimous in finding that “had they been proved, [some of the acts complained of] could have amounted to human trafficking” and -further on - that no investigation had taken place.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">What I find even more striking in the present case is the fact that having raided the villa, where the first applicant was allegedly held against her will, and released her seventeen days after obtaining information that the mother feared that her daughter might be subjected to forced prostitution, the authorities decided not only to dismiss these complaints without any further enquiries, but also to immediately institute criminal proceedings against the seventeen-year-old girl and her mother for perjury and false accusations to the effect “that X., Y. and Z. [had] deprived [the minor] of her liberty by keeping her in the villa, thus accusing them of kidnapping while knowing they were innocent” (paragraph 30).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">It appears somewhat illogical that having “opined that the circumstances of the present case concerned a Roma marriage”, the authorities nonetheless undertook protective measures by placing the girl in a Caritas shelter and then handing her into her mother’s care, instead of leaving her free to happily rejoin her “husband” after an action apparently regarded as an unnecessary interference in their peaceful family affairs.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">I find it alarming that, after receiving further detailed and insistent complaints from the applicants (paragraphs 16 and 25) through the Bulgarian embassy in Rome, the Italian authorities insisted on proceeding with the accusations against the applicants rather than investigating the circumstances complained of. It is difficult to avoid the impression that this was done in an attempt to actively disprove not only the purposes for which the minor had allegedly been forcefully held in the villa, but also the very fact of the unlawful deprivation of liberty, from which they released her. Indeed, the respondent Italian Government relied on the proceedings instituted for perjury to convince the Court that “the facts as alleged by the applicants had been entirely disproved during domestic proceedings” (paragraph 90) and that the “traditional marriage” understanding of the events had been considered “truthful by the judgment of the Turin Investigating Magistrate” in discontinuing the proceedings against the first applicant as well as found “probable by the Turin Tribunal in its judgment of 2006” acquitting the third applicant (paragraphs 92 and 93). In fact, the judge of the Turin Tribunal found the photographs of the “marriage” to depict a scene that was rather grim for Roma traditions. Acting in proceedings </span><span class="sA36B60A1">in absentia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, where the third applicant was neither summoned to appear, nor able to defend herself, or explain the circumstances, he dismissed the accusations of perjury and false accusations against her, noting also that X., Y. and Z. had availed themselves of their right to remain silent in the “false accusations of kidnapping”, allegedly raised by the mother.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicants’ allegations of ill-treatment by the Italian authorities were not limited to the failure to undertake timely action for the release and protection of a minor, as suggested by paragraphs 102-108 of the judgment. In this regard I see no reason to join the majority in their approval of the “promptness and diligence” (paragraph 102) displayed in an action which the national authorities themselves deemed unnecessary and caused by false assertions.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Nor were the applicants’ complaints about the manner in which they were allegedly questioned separated from those concerning the attitude of the Italian authorities – as examined in paragraphs 115-118. In this regard, the very fact that the criminal proceedings for perjury and false accusations were instituted a few hours after the allegedly threatening interrogations suffices to support a conclusion that the threats were quite realistic.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicants’ submissions about ill-treatment by the authorities concerned the overall approach of the Italian investigation authorities to their complaints. Seeing that they were not only dismissed without any enquiries, but were also followed by an attempt to actively disprove them, I cannot come to any explanation for this treatment other than an assumption on the part of the authorities that the applicants had been telling lies from the outset. This assumption transpires from the reluctance to organise the timely release of the minor, the manner in which she and her mother were hastily questioned under threat and the immediate (but unsuccessful) institution of proceedings for perjury in an attempt to establish that their complaints were nothing but false accusations, made while knowing that X., Y. and Z. were innocent.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">This explanation appears to be more reasonable than that offered to the Court, namely, that the “Italian authorities opined that the circumstances of the present case fell within the context of a Roma marriage”. Even if correct (and I would venture to doubt it), such an “opinion” could not reasonably explain the manner in which the authorities dealt with the applicants’ complaints of ill-treatment, non-consensual sex, forced participation in criminal activities, etc., unless it is seen as an understanding that a Roma marriage constituted an agreement of the parents to sell a bride “for all purposes”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">I find myself unable to accept either of these two explanations for the manner in which the authorities dealt with the applicants’ complaints and find each of them to be based on equally inappropriate assumptions.</span></p></div></div></div></div>			<div id="notice"><div class="content" title=""><div title="">	<div class="row noticefield">		<div class="span2 noticefieldheading ">Originating Body</div>		<div class="col-offset-2 noticefieldvalue">							<div>Court (Second Section)												</div>																				</div>	</div></div><div title="">	<div class="row noticefield">		<div class="span2 noticefieldheading ">Document Type</div>		<div class="col-offset-2 noticefieldvalue">							<div>Judgment (Merits and Just Satisfaction)												</div>																				</div>	</div></div><div></div><div></div><div title="">	<div class="row noticefield">		<div class="span2 noticefieldheading ">Title</div>		<div class="col-offset-2 noticefieldvalue">							<div>CASE OF M.
