The report concluded that the applicant’s injuries were sufficient to endanger her life.

The applicant’s mother alleged that H.O. had told them to get into his car and that he would kill them if they refused. Since they did not want to get into the car and had started running away, H.O. had driven his car into the applicant, who had fallen.

They noted that the applicant had already commenced divorce proceedings and that she did not want to return to live with H.O. The applicant’s brother and his wife alleged that the applicant was discouraged by her mother from going back to her husband and that they knew nothing about the threats issued by H.O. and his father. H.O. contended that his only intention was to bring his family together, but that his mother-in-law was preventing this. He also alleged that he had gone to the applicant’s brother and family elders for help, but to no avail.

H.O.’s repeated requests for the return of his wife had been turned down by the applicant’s mother and the latter had insulted H.O. and made allegations that H.O. had issued death threats against her. H.O. had spent twenty-five days in prison for running a car into his mother-in-law and, following his release, had asked a number of mediators to convince his wife to return home. However, the mother did not allow the applicant to go back to H.O. Both parties had issued threats against each other. Furthermore, the mother had wished to separate her daughter from H.O. in order to take revenge on her ex-husband, had constantly made slanderous allegations and had also “wasted” the security forces’ time.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">30.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 14 April 1998 the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor indicted H.O. and his father A.O. and charged them with issuing death threats against the applicant and her mother, contrary to Article 188 § 1 of the Criminal Code.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">31.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 30 April 1998 the Diyarbakır Criminal Court released H.O. pending trial.

The applicant, worried that her husband would again be violent towards her, said to her mother “this man is going to tear me to pieces!” The applicant’s mother encouraged the applicant to return home with the children. Three-quarters of an hour later one of the children went back, saying that his father had stabbed and killed his mother. The applicant’s mother rushed to the applicant’s house. She saw that the applicant was lying on the floor bleeding. With the help of neighbours, she put the applicant into a taxi and took her to the Diyarbakır State Hospital. The hospital authorities told her that the applicant’s condition was serious and transferred her to the Dicle University Hospital, which was better equipped. The medical report on the applicant noted seven knife injuries on different parts of her body.

The police confiscated the knife which he had used during the incident. H.O. maintained that his wife and children were still not at home when he came back at 6 p.m. He had telephoned them and asked them to come back. On their return, he asked the applicant, “Why are you wandering outside? Why haven’t you cooked anything for me?” The applicant replied, “We ate at my mother’s”, and brought him a plate of fruit. They continued arguing. He told her, “Why are you going to your mother so often? Don’t go there so much, stay at home and look after the children!” The argument escalated. At some point, the applicant attacked him with a fork. They started fighting, during which he lost control, grabbed the fruit knife and stabbed her; he did not remember how many times. He claimed that his wife was bigger than him, so he had to respond when she attacked him. He added that his wife was not a bad person and that they had lived together peacefully until two years previously. However, they started fighting when the applicant’s mother began interfering with their marriage. He stated that he regretted what he had done.

However, he was released at the first hearing. She maintained that her client and the applicant had been obliged to withdraw their complaints due to continuing death threats and pressure from H.O. She further stated that there was hearsay about H.O. being involved in trafficking women. Finally, she referred to the incident of 4 March 1998 (see paragraph 23 above), arguing that, following such a serious incident, H.O.’s release was morally damaging and requested that he be detained on remand.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">40.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 2 November 2001 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection with the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office against the medical report of the Dicle Medical Faculty Hospital, which had concluded that the applicant’s injuries were not life-threatening.

The effect of such violence on the physical and mental integrity of women is to deprive them the equal enjoyment, exercise and knowledge of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

In recent years there has been an increase in “protection orders” or injunctions issued by family courts. However, some courts, in response to applications made to them by women in mortal danger, are still setting hearings two or even three months ahead. Under these circumstances, judges and prosecutors treat an action under Law no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4320 as if it were a form of divorce action, whereas the point of the Law is to take urgent action on behalf of women who are seeking to protect their own lives.

The Mor Çatı Foundation has identified serious problems with the implementation of Law no. 4320. In particular, it was observed that domestic violence is still treated with tolerance at police stations, and that some police officers try to act as arbitrators, or take the side of the male, or suggest that the woman drop her complaint. There are also serious problems in serving the injunction issued by a court under Law no. 4320 on the husband. In the case of a number of women wishing to work with the Mor Çatı Foundation, injunctions were not implemented because their husbands were police officers or had friendly relations with officers at the police station in question.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">93.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, there are unreasonable delays in issuing injunctions by the courts. This results from the attitude of the courts in treating domestic violence complaints as a form of divorce action. It is considered that behind such delays lies a suspicion that women might be making such applications when they have not suffered violence. The allegations that women abuse Law no. 4320 are not correct. Since the economic burden of the home lies almost 100% with men, it would be impossible for women to request implementation of Law no. 4320 unless they were confronted with mortal danger. Finally, the injunctions at issue are generally narrow in scope or are not extended by the courts.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Research report prepared by the Women’s Rights Information and Implementation Centre of the Diyarbakır Bar Association (KA</span><span class="sA36B60A1">‑</span><span class="sA36B60A1">MER) on the Implementation of Law no. 4320, dated 25</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">November 2005</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">94.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">According to this report, a culture of violence has developed in Turkey and violence is tolerated in many areas of life.

Nonetheless, it appears that a culture of domestic violence has placed women in double jeopardy, both as victims of violence and because they are denied effective access to justice. Women from vulnerable groups, such as those from low-income families or who are fleeing conflict or natural disasters, are particularly at risk.

The police are reluctant to prevent and investigate family violence, including the violent deaths of women. Prosecutors refuse to open investigations into cases involving domestic violence or to order protective measures for women at risk from their family or community. The police and courts do not ensure that men, who are served with court orders, including protection orders, comply with them. They accord them undue leniency in sentencing, on the grounds of “provocation” by their victim and on the flimsiest of evidence.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">102.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">There are many barriers facing women who need access to justice and protection from violence. Police officers often believe that their duty is to encourage women to return home and “make peace” and fail to investigate the women’s complaints. Many women, particularly in rural areas, are unable to make formal complaints, because leaving their neighbourhoods subjects them to intense scrutiny, criticism and, in some cases, violence.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">103.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, although some courts appear to have begun implementing the reforms, the discretion accorded to the courts continues to accord the perpetrators of domestic violence unwarranted leniency.

To that end, cases in the Diyarbakır assize courts and children’s courts between 1999 and 2005 were examined. In these seven years, 59 cases were identified in which a judgment was given.

These acts of violence had resulted in the death of the applicant’s mother and caused the applicant intense suffering and anguish. While there were intervals between the impugned events, the Court considers that the overall violence to which the applicant and her mother were subjected over a long period of time cannot be seen as individual and separate episodes and must therefore be considered together as a chain of connected events.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">112.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">This being so, the Court notes that the applicant has submitted her application within six months of the killing of her mother by H.O., which event may be considered as the time that she became aware of the ineffectiveness of the remedies in domestic law, as a result of the authorities’ failure to stop H.O. committing further violence. Given that these circumstances do not disclose any indication of a delay on the part of the applicant in introducing her application once it became apparent that no redress for her complaints was forthcoming, the Court considers that the relevant date for the purposes of the six-month time-limit should not be considered to be a date earlier than at least 13 March 2002 (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">54 above). In any event, the applicant’s former husband had continued to issue threats against her life and well-being and, therefore, it cannot be said that the said pattern of violence has come to an end (see paragraphs 59-69 above).</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">113.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the specific context of this case, it follows that the applicant’s complaints have been introduced within the six-month time-limit required by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.

They maintained that the applicant had also not availed herself of the protection afforded by Law no. 4320 and that she had prevented the public prosecutor from applying to the family court, in that she had withdrawn her complaints. They submitted further that the applicant could have availed herself of the administrative and civil law remedies whose effectiveness had been recognised by the Court in previous cases (citing </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Aytekin v.

She argued that the domestic remedies had proven to be ineffective given the failure of the authorities to protect her mother’s life and to prevent her husband from inflicting ill-treatment on her and her mother. As regards the Government’s reliance on Law no. 4320, to the effect that she had not availed herself of the remedies therein, the applicant noted that the said law had come into force on 14 January 1998, whereas a significant part of the events at issue had taken place prior to that date. Prior to the entry into force of Law no. 4320, there was no mechanism for protection against domestic violence. In any event, despite her numerous criminal complaints to the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, none of the protective measures provided for in Law no. 4320 had been taken to protect the life and well-being of the applicant and her mother.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">116.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court observes that the main question with regard to the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies is whether the applicants have failed to make use of available remedies in domestic law, particularly those provided by Law no. 4320, and whether the domestic authorities were required to pursue the criminal proceedings against the applicant’s husband despite the withdrawal of complaints by the victims. These questions are inextricably linked to the question of the effectiveness of the domestic remedies in providing sufficient safeguards for the applicant and her mother against domestic violence. Accordingly, the Court joins these questions to the merits and will examine them under Articles 2, 3 and 14 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Şemsi Önen v.

In this connection, she pointed out that, despite their numerous criminal complaints to the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, none of the protective measures provided for in Law no. 4320 had been taken to protect the life and well-being of herself and her mother. Conversely, on a number of occasions, the authorities had tried to persuade the applicant and her mother to abandon their complaints against H.O. The domestic authorities had remained totally passive in the face of death threats issued by H.O. and had left her and her mother to the mercy of their aggressor.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">120.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant pointed out that, by a petition dated 27 February 2002, her mother had applied to the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office and had informed the authorities of the death threats issued by H.O. However, the public prosecutor had done nothing to protect the life of the deceased. In the applicant’s opinion, the fact that the authorities had not taken her mother’s complaint seriously was a clear indication that domestic violence was tolerated by society and the national authorities.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">121.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also claimed that, although H.O. had been convicted of murder, the punishment imposed on him was not a deterrent and was considerably less than the normal sentence imposed for murder. The imposition of a lenient sentence had resulted from the fact that, in his defence submissions before the Assize Court, the accused had claimed to have killed her mother in order to protect his honour. It was the general practice of the criminal courts in Turkey to mitigate sentences in cases of “honour crimes”. In cases concerning “honour crimes”, the criminal courts imposed a very lenient punishment or no punishment at all on the perpetrators of such crimes.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Government</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">122.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government stressed that the local authorities had provided immediate and tangible follow-up to the complaints lodged by the applicant and her mother. In this connection, subsequent to the filing of their complaints, the authorities had registered the complaints, conducted medical examinations, heard witnesses, conducted a survey of the scenes of the incidents and transmitted the complaints to the competent legal authorities. When necessary and depending on the gravity of the incident, the aggressor had been remanded in custody and had been convicted by the criminal courts. These proceedings had been carried out within the shortest time possible. The authorities had displayed diligence and were sensitive to the complaints, and no negligence had been shown.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">123.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, by withdrawing their complaints, the applicant and her mother had prevented the authorities from pursuing criminal proceedings against H.O. and had thus contributed to the impunity enjoyed by the aggressor. In this regard, it did not appear from the case file that the applicant and her mother had withdrawn their complaints as a result of any pressure exerted on them either by H.O. or the public prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The pursuit of criminal proceedings against the aggressor was dependent on the complaints lodged or pursued by the applicant, since the criminal acts in question had not resulted in sickness or unfitness for work for ten days or more, within the meaning of Articles 456 § 4, 457 and 460 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, in most cases the criminal courts had not convicted H.O. because the evidence against him was insufficient. Accordingly, the authorities could not be expected to separate the applicant and her husband and convict the latter while they were living together as a family, as this would amount to a breach of their rights under Article 8 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">124.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the petition filed by the applicant’s mother on 27</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">February 2002, the Government claimed that the content of this petition was no different to the previous ones and was of a general nature. There was no tangible fact or specific indication that her life was indeed in danger. In the petition the mother had failed to request any protection at all but she had merely requested a speedy examination of her complaint and the punishment of the applicant’s husband. Nonetheless, subsequent to the receipt of the petition dated 27 February 2002, the authorities had registered the complaint and had held a hearing on 27 May 2002, which had been followed by other hearings. Finally, following the killing of the applicant’s mother by H.O., the latter had been convicted and had received a heavy punishment.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">3.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Interights, the third-party intervener</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">125.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Referring to international practice, Interights submitted that where the national authorities failed to act with due diligence to prevent violence against women, including violence by private actors, or to investigate, prosecute and punish such violence, the State might be responsible for such acts. The </span><span class="sA36B60A1">jus cogens</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> nature of the right to freedom from torture and the right to life required exemplary diligence on the part of the State with respect to investigation and prosecution of these acts.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">126.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the context of domestic violence, victims were often intimidated or threatened into either not reporting the crime or withdrawing complaints. However, the responsibility to ensure accountability and guard against impunity lay with the State, not with the victim. International practice recognised that a broad range of interested persons, not just the victim, should be able to report and initiate an investigation into domestic violence. Further, international practice increasingly suggested that where there was sufficient evidence and it was considered in the public interest, prosecution of perpetrators of domestic violence should continue even when a victim withdrew her complaint. These developments indicated a trend away from requiring victim participation towards placing the responsibility for effective prosecution squarely on the State.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">127.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">While a decision not to prosecute in a particular case would not necessarily be in breach of due diligence obligations, a law or practice which automatically paralysed a domestic violence investigation or prosecution where a victim withdrew her complaint would be.

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Osman v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 28 October 1998, § 115, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Reports</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> 1998-VIII, cited in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Kontrová v.

Not every claimed risk to life, therefore, can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. Another relevant consideration is the need to ensure that the police exercise their powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Osman</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 116).</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">130.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the opinion of the Court, where there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obligation to protect the right to life in the context of their above-mentioned duty to prevent and suppress offences against the person, it must be established to its satisfaction that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. Furthermore, having regard to the nature of the right protected by Article 2, a right fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge. This is a question which can only be answered in the light of all the circumstances of any particular case (ibid.).</span></p><p class="s6EF3B654"><span class="s29100277">(b)</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Application of the above principles to the present case</span></p><p class="s8C50CFA1"><span class="sA36B60A1">(i)</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Scope of the case</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">131.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On the above understanding, the Court will ascertain whether the national authorities have fulfilled their positive obligation to take preventive operational measures to protect the applicant’s mother’s right to life. In this connection, it must establish whether the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of the applicant’s mother from criminal acts by H.O. As it appears from the parties’ submissions, a crucial question in the instant case is whether the local authorities displayed due diligence to prevent violence against the applicant and her mother, in particular by pursuing criminal or other appropriate preventive measures against H.O. despite the withdrawal of complaints by the victims.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">132.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, before embarking upon these issues, the Court must stress that the issue of domestic violence, which can take various forms ranging from physical to psychological violence or verbal abuse, cannot be confined to the circumstances of the present case. It is a general problem which concerns all member States and which does not always surface since it often takes place within personal relationships or closed circuits and it is not only women who are affected. The Court acknowledges that men may also be the victims of domestic violence and, indeed, that children, too, are often casualties of the phenomenon, whether directly or indirectly.

She thus became a target for H.O., who blamed her for being the cause of their problems (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">28 above).

Both victims suffered severe injuries, and the medical reports indicated that the applicant was unfit for work for seven days and that her mother’s injuries were life-threatening. Subsequent to this incident, the victims asked the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office to take protective measures in view of the death threats issued by H.O., and the applicant initiated divorce proceedings. The police investigation into the victims’ allegations of death threats concluded that both parties had threatened each other and that the applicant’s mother had made such allegations in order to separate her daughter from H.O. for the purpose of revenge, and had also “wasted” the security forces’ time. Criminal proceedings were instituted against H.O. for issuing death threats and attempted murder, but following H.O.’s release from custody (see paragraph 31 above) the applicant and her mother again withdrew their complaints. This time, although the prosecuting authorities dropped the charges against H.O. for issuing death threats and hitting the applicant, the Diyarbakır Assize Court convicted him for causing injuries to the mother and sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment, which was later commuted to a fine (see paragraphs 23-36 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">(v)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 29 October 2001 H.O. stabbed the applicant seven times following her visit to her mother. H.O. surrendered to the police claiming that he had attacked his wife in the course of a fight caused by his mother-in-law’s interference with their marriage. After taking H.O.’s statements the police officers released him. However, the applicant’s mother applied to the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office seeking the detention of H.O., and also claimed that she and her daughter had had to withdraw their complaints in the past because of death threats and pressure by H.O. As a result, H.O. was convicted of knife assault and sentenced to a fine (see paragraphs 37-44 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">(vi)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 14 November 2001 H.O. threatened the applicant but the prosecuting authorities did not press charges for lack of concrete evidence (see paragraphs 45 and 46 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">(vii)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 19 November 2001 the applicant’s mother filed a petition with the local public prosecutor’s office, complaining about the ongoing death threats and harassment by H.O., who had been carrying weapons. Again, the police took statements from H.O. and released him, but the public prosecutor pressed charges against him for making death threats (see paragraphs 47</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">49 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">(viii)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Later, on 27 February 2002, the applicant’s mother applied to the public prosecutor’s office, informing him that H.O.’s threats had intensified and that their lives were in immediate danger. She therefore asked the police to take action against H.O. The police took statements from H.O. and the Diyarbakır Magistrate’s Court questioned him about the allegations only after the killing of the applicant’s mother. H.O. denied the allegations and claimed that he did not wish his wife to visit her mother, who was living an immoral life (see paragraphs 51-52 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">134.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In view of the above events, it appears that there was an escalating violence against the applicant and her mother by H.O. The crimes committed by H.O. were sufficiently serious to warrant preventive measures and there was a continuing threat to the health and safety of the victims. When examining the history of the relationship, it was obvious that the perpetrator had a record of domestic violence and there was therefore a significant risk of further violence.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">135.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, the victims’ situations were also known to the authorities and the mother had submitted a petition to the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, stating that her life was in immediate danger and requesting the police to take action against H.O. However, the authorities’ reaction to the applicant’s mother’s request was limited to taking statements from H.O. about the mother’s allegations. Approximately two weeks after this request, on 11 March 2002, he killed the applicant’s mother (see paragraph 54 above).</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">136.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Having regard to the foregoing, the Court finds that the local authorities could have foreseen a lethal attack by H.O. While the Court cannot conclude with certainty that matters would have turned out differently and that the killing would not have occurred if the authorities had acted otherwise, it reiterates that a failure to take reasonable measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm is sufficient to engage the responsibility of the State (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">E. and Others v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;33218/96&quot;]}" target="_blank">33218/96</a>, § 99, 26 November 2002).

In their opinion, any further interference by the authorities would have amounted to a breach of the victims’ Article 8 rights. The applicant explained that she and her mother had had to withdraw their complaints because of death threats and pressure exerted by H.O.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">138.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes at the outset that there seems to be no general consensus among States Parties regarding the pursuance of the criminal prosecution against perpetrators of domestic violence when the victim withdraws her complaints (see paragraphs 87 and 88 above). Nevertheless, there appears to be an acknowledgement of the duty on the part of the authorities to strike a balance between a victim’s Article 2, Article 3 or Article 8 rights in deciding on a course of action. In this connection, having examined the practices in the member States (see paragraph 89 above), the Court observes that there are certain factors that can be taken into account in deciding to pursue the prosecution:</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">the seriousness of the offence;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">whether the victim’s injuries are physical or psychological;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">if the defendant used a weapon;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">if the defendant has made any threats since the attack;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">if the defendant planned the attack;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">the effect (including psychological) on any children living in the household;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">the chances of the defendant offending again;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">the continuing threat to the health and safety of the victim or anyone else who was, or could become, involved;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">the current state of the victim’s relationship with the defendant and the effect on that relationship of continuing with the prosecution against the victim’s wishes;</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">the history of the relationship, particularly if there had been any other violence in the past; and</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">–</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">the defendant’s criminal history, particularly any previous violence.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">139.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It can be inferred from this practice that the more serious the offence or the greater the risk of further offences, the more likely that the prosecution should continue in the public interest, even if victims withdraw their complaints.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">140.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the Government’s argument that any attempt by the authorities to separate the applicant and her husband would have amounted to a breach of their right to family life, and bearing in mind that under Turkish law there is no requirement to pursue the prosecution in cases where the victim withdraws her complaint and did not suffer injuries which renders her unfit for work for ten or more days, the Court will now examine whether the local authorities struck a proper balance between the victim’s Article 2 and Article 8 rights.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">141.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, the Court notes that H.O. resorted to violence from the very beginning of his relationship with the applicant. On many instances both the applicant and her mother suffered physical injuries and were subjected to psychological pressure, given the anguish and fear. For some assaults H.O. used lethal weapons, such as a knife or a shotgun, and he constantly issued death threats against the applicant and her mother. Having regard to the circumstances of the killing of the applicant’s mother, it may also be stated that H.O. had planned the attack, since he had been carrying a knife and a gun and had been wandering around the victim’s house on occasions prior to the attack (see paragraphs 47 and 54 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">142.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant’s mother became a target as a result of her perceived involvement in the couple’s relationship, and the couple’s children can also be considered as victims on account of the psychological effects of the ongoing violence in the family home. As noted above, in the instant case, further violence was not only possible but even foreseeable, given the violent behaviour and criminal record of H.O., his continuing threat to the health and safety of the victims and the history of violence in the relationship (see paragraphs 10, 13, 23, 37, 45, 47 and 51 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">143.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the Court’s opinion, it does not appear that the local authorities sufficiently considered the above factors when repeatedly deciding to discontinue the criminal proceedings against H.O. Instead, they seem to have given exclusive weight to the need to refrain from interfering with what they perceived to be a “family matter” (see paragraph 123 above). Moreover, there is no indication that the authorities considered the motives behind the withdrawal of the complaints. This is despite the applicant’s mother’s indication to the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor that she and her daughter had withdrawn their complaints because of the death threats issued and pressure exerted on them by H.O. (see paragraph 39 above). It is also striking that the victims withdrew their complaints when H.O. was at liberty or following his release from custody (see paragraphs 9-12, 17-19, 31 and</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">35 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">144.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the Government’s argument that any further interference by the national authorities would have amounted to a breach of the victims’ rights under Article 8 of the Convention, the Court notes its ruling in a similar case of domestic violence (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Bevacqua and S. v. Bulgaria</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"><a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;71127/01&quot;]}" target="_blank">71127/01</a>, § 83, 12 June 2008), where it held that the authorities’ view that no assistance was required as the dispute concerned a “private matter” was incompatible with their positive obligations to secure the enjoyment of the applicants’ rights. Moreover, the Court reiterates that, in some instances, the national authorities’ interference with the private or family life of the individuals might be necessary in order to protect the health and rights of others or to prevent commission of criminal acts (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">K.A. and A.D. v. Belgium</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, nos. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;42758/98&quot;]}" target="_blank">42758/98</a> and <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;45558/99&quot;]}" target="_blank">45558/99</a>, § 81, 17 February 2005). The seriousness of the risk to the applicant’s mother rendered such intervention by the authorities necessary in the present case.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">145.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, the Court regrets to note that the criminal investigations in the instant case were strictly dependent on the pursuance of complaints by the applicant and her mother on account of the domestic-law provisions in force at the relevant time; namely Articles 456 § 4, 457 and 460 of the now defunct Criminal Code, which prevented the prosecuting authorities from pursuing the criminal investigations because the criminal acts in question had not resulted in sickness or unfitness for work for ten days or more (see paragraph 70 above). It observes that the application of the above-mentioned provisions and the cumulative failure of the domestic authorities to pursue criminal proceedings against H.O. deprived the applicant’s mother of the protection of her life and safety. In other words, the legislative framework then in force, particularly the minimum ten days’ sickness unfitness requirement, fell short of the requirements inherent in the State’s positive obligations to establish and apply effectively a system punishing all forms of domestic violence and providing sufficient safeguards for the victims. The Court thus considers that, bearing in mind the seriousness of the crimes committed by H.O. in the past, the prosecuting authorities should have been able to pursue the proceedings as a matter of public interest, regardless of the victims’ withdrawal of complaints (see, in this respect, Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of the Ministers, paragraphs 80-82 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">146.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The legislative framework preventing effective protection for victims of domestic violence aside, the Court must also consider whether the local authorities displayed due diligence to protect the right to life of the applicant’s mother in other respects.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">147.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, the Court notes that despite the deceased’s complaint that H.O. had been harassing her, invading her privacy by wandering around her property and carrying knives and guns (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">47 above), the police and prosecuting authorities failed either to place H.O. in detention or to take other appropriate action in respect of the allegation that he had a shotgun and had made violent threats with it (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Kontrová</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 53). While the Government argued that there was no tangible evidence that the applicant’s mother’s life was in imminent danger, the Court observes that it is not in fact apparent that the authorities assessed the threat posed by H.O. and concluded that his detention was a disproportionate step in the circumstances; rather the authorities failed to address the issues at all. In any event, the Court would underline that in domestic violence cases perpetrators’ rights cannot supersede victims’ human rights to life and to physical and mental integrity (see the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Fatma Yıldırım v. Austria</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">A.T. v. Hungary</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> decisions of the CEDAW Committee, both cited above, §§ 12.1.5 and 9.3 respectively).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">148.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, in the light of the State’s positive obligation to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk, it might have been expected that the authorities, faced with a suspect known to have a criminal record of perpetrating violent attacks, would take special measures consonant with the gravity of the situation with a view to protecting the applicant’s mother. To that end, the local public prosecutor or the judge at the Diyarbakır Magistrate’s Court could have ordered on his/her initiative one or more of the protective measures enumerated under sections 1 and 2 of Law no. 4320 (see paragraph 70 above). They could also have issued an injunction with the effect of banning H.O. from contacting, communicating with or approaching the applicant’s mother or entering defined areas (see, in this respect, Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of the Ministers, paragraph 82 above). On the contrary, in response to the applicant’s mother’s repeated requests for protection, the police and the Diyarbakır Magistrate’s Court merely took statements from H.O. and released him (see paragraphs 47-52 above). While the authorities remained passive for almost two weeks apart from taking statements, H.O. shot dead the applicant’s mother.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">149.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the national authorities cannot be considered to have displayed due diligence. They therefore failed in their positive obligation to protect the right to life of the applicant’s mother within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The effectiveness of the criminal investigation into the killing of the applicant’s mother</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">150.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court reiterates that the positive obligations laid down in the first sentence of Article 2 of the Convention also require by implication that an efficient and independent judicial system should be set in place by which the cause of a murder can be established and the guilty parties punished (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Calvelli and Ciglio v.

The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Paul and Audrey</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Edwards v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;46477/99&quot;]}" target="_blank">46477/99</a>, §§ 69 and 71, ECHR 2002-II). A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in the context of an effective investigation within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Yaşa v.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Turkey</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 2 September 1998, §§</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">102</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">04, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Reports </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">1998-VI, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Çakıcı v.

It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of tolerance of unlawful acts (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Avşar v.

However, although H.O. was tried and convicted of murder and illegal possession of a firearm by the Diyarbakır Assize Court, the proceedings are still pending before the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 57 and 58 above). Accordingly, the criminal proceedings in question, which have already lasted more than six years, cannot be described as a prompt response by the authorities in investigating an intentional killing where the perpetrator had already confessed to the crime.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">3.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Conclusion</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">152.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the above-mentioned failures rendered recourse to criminal and civil remedies equally ineffective in the circumstances.

The obstacles resulting from the legislation and failure to use the means available undermined the deterrent effect of the judicial system in place and the role it was required to play in preventing a violation of the applicant’s mother’s right to life as enshrined in Article 2 of the Convention. The Court reiterates in this connection that, once the situation has been brought to their attention, the national authorities cannot rely on the victim’s attitude for their failure to take adequate measures which could prevent the likelihood of an aggressor carrying out his threats against the physical integrity of the victim (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Osman</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 116).

Despite the ongoing violence and her repeated requests for help, however, the authorities had failed to protect her from her husband. It was as though the violence had been inflicted under State supervision.

Moreover, under Article 19 of the Convention and under the principle that the Convention is intended to guarantee not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective rights, the Court has to ensure that a State’s obligation to protect the rights of those under its jurisdiction is adequately discharged (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Nikolova and Velichkova v.

After each incident involving violence, the applicant was taken for medical examination and criminal proceedings were instituted against her husband. The police and prosecuting authorities questioned H.O. in relation to his criminal acts, placed him in detention on two occasions, indicted him for issuing death threats and inflicting actual bodily harm and, subsequent to his conviction for stabbing the applicant seven times, sentenced him to pay a fine (see paragraphs 13, 24 and 44 above).</span></p><p class="s4991353C"><span class="sBB9EE52A">167.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, none of these measures were sufficient to stop H.O. from perpetrating further violence. In this respect, the Government blamed the applicant for withdrawing her complaints and failing to cooperate with the authorities, which prevented the latter from continuing the criminal proceedings against H.O., pursuant to the domestic law provisions requiring the active involvement of the victim (see paragraph 70 above).</span></p><p class="s4991353C"><span class="sBB9EE52A">168.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court reiterates its opinion in respect of the complaint under Article 2 of the Convention, namely that the legislative framework should have enabled the prosecuting authorities to pursue the criminal investigations against H.O. despite the withdrawal of complaints by the applicant on the basis that the violence committed by H.O. was sufficiently serious to warrant prosecution and that there was a constant threat to the applicant’s physical integrity (see paragraphs 137-48 above).</span></p><p class="s4991353C"><span class="sBB9EE52A">169.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, it cannot be said that the local authorities displayed the required diligence to prevent the recurrence of violent attacks against the applicant, since the applicant’s husband perpetrated them without hindrance and with impunity to the detriment of the rights recognised by the Convention (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Maria da Penha v.

H.R., Annual Report 2000, OEA/Ser.L/V.II.111 Doc. 20 rev. (2000), §§ 42-44). By way of example, the Court notes that, following the first major incident (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above), H.O. again beat the applicant severely, causing her injuries which were sufficient to endanger her life, but he was released pending trial “considering the nature of the offence and the fact that the applicant had regained full health”. The proceedings were ultimately discontinued because the applicant withdrew her complaints (see paragraphs 13 and 19 above). Again, although H.O. assaulted the applicant and her mother using a knife and caused them severe injuries, the prosecuting authorities terminated the proceedings without conducting any meaningful investigation (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). Likewise, H.O. ran his car into the applicant and her mother, this time causing injuries to the former and life-threatening injuries to the latter. He spent only twenty-five days in prison and received a fine for inflicting serious injuries on the applicant’s mother (see paragraphs 23-36 above). Finally, the Court was particularly struck by the Diyarbakır Magistrate’s Court’s decision to impose merely a small fine, which could be paid by instalments, on H.O. as punishment for stabbing the applicant seven times (see paragraphs 37 and</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">44 above).</span></p><p class="s4991353C"><span class="sBB9EE52A">170.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the response to the conduct of the applicant’s former husband was manifestly inadequate to the gravity of the offences in question (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Ali and Ayşe</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Duran v.

It therefore observes that the judicial decisions in this case reveal a lack of efficacy and a certain degree of tolerance, and had no noticeable preventive or deterrent effect on the conduct of H.O.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">171.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the Government’s assertion that, in addition to the available remedies under Law no. 4320, the applicant could have sought shelter in one of the guest houses set up to protect women, the Court notes that until 14 January 1998 – the date on which Law no. 4320 entered into force – Turkish law did not provide for specific administrative and policing measures designed to protect vulnerable persons against domestic violence. Even after that date, it does not appear that the domestic authorities effectively applied the measures and sanctions provided by that Law with a view to protecting the applicant against her husband. Taking into account the overall amount of violence perpetrated by H.O., the public prosecutor’s office ought to have applied on its own motion the measures contained in Law no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4320, without expecting a specific request to be made by the applicant for the implementation of that Law.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">172.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">This being said, even assuming that the applicant had been admitted to one of the guest houses, as suggested by the Government, the Court notes that this would only be a temporary solution. Furthermore, it has not been suggested that there was any official arrangement to provide for the security of the victims staying in those houses.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">173.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Finally, the Court notes with grave concern that the violence suffered by the applicant had not come to an end and that the authorities had continued to display inaction. In this connection, the Court points out that, immediately after his release from prison, H.O. again issued threats against the physical integrity of the applicant (see paragraph 59 above). Despite the applicant’s petition of 15 April 2008 requesting the prosecuting authorities to take measures for her protection, nothing was done until after the Court requested the Government to provide information about the measures that have been taken by their authorities. Following this request, on the instructions of the Ministry of Justice, the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor questioned H.O. about the death threats issued by him and took statements from the applicant’s current boyfriend (see paragraphs 60-67 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">174.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant’s legal representative again informed the Court that the applicant’s life was in immediate danger, given the authorities’ continuous failure to take sufficient measures to protect her client (see paragraph 68 above). It appears that following the transmission of this complaint and the Court’s request for an explanation in this respect, the local authorities have now put in place specific measures to ensure the protection of the applicant (see paragraph 69 above).</span></p><p class="s4991353C"><span class="sBB9EE52A">175.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Having regard to the overall ineffectiveness of the remedies suggested by the Government in respect of the complaints under Article 3, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.</span></p><p class="sD7BB7D16"><span class="sBB9EE52A">176.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention as a result of the State authorities’ failure to take protective measures in the form of effective deterrence against serious breaches of the applicant’s personal integrity by her husband.</span></p><p class="s9F223FEE"><span class="sBB9EE52A">IV.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLES 2 AND 3</span></p><p class="s87F05BA2"><span class="sBB9EE52A">177.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant complained under Article 14 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3, that she and her mother had been discriminated against on the basis of their gender.</span></p><p class="s6477A72F"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Article 14 of the Convention provides:</span></p><p class="sB1BD30C0"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.”</span></p><p class="sC31874BD"><span class="s29100277">A.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The parties’ submissions</span></p><p class="s25BD2B45"><span class="sA36B60A1">1.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The applicant</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">178.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant alleged that the domestic law of the respondent State was discriminatory and insufficient to protect women, since a woman’s life was treated as inferior in the name of family unity. The former Civil Code, which was in force at the relevant time, contained numerous provisions distinguishing between men and women, such as the husband being the head of the family, his wishes taking precedence as the representative of the family union. The then Criminal Code also treated women as second-class citizens. A woman was viewed primarily as the property of society and of the male within the family. The most important indicator of this was that sexual offences were included in the section entitled “Crimes Relating to General Morality and Family Order”, whereas in fact sexual offences against women are direct attacks on a woman’s personal rights and freedoms. It was because of this perception that the Criminal Code imposed lighter sentences on persons who had murdered their wives for reasons of family honour. The fact that H.O. received a sentence of fifteen years is a consequence of that classification in the Criminal Code.</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">179.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Despite the reforms carried out by the Government in the areas of the Civil Code and Criminal Code in 2002 and 2004 respectively, domestic violence inflicted by men is still tolerated and impunity is granted to the aggressors by judicial and administrative bodies. The applicant and her mother had been victims of violations of Articles 2, 3, 6 and 13 of the Convention merely because of the fact that they were women. In this connection, the applicant drew the Court’s attention to the improbability of any men being a victim of similar violations.</span></p><p class="sC702907E"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The Government</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">180.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government averred that there was no gender discrimination in the instant case, since the violence in question was mutual. Furthermore, it cannot be claimed that there was institutionalised discrimination resulting from the criminal or family laws or from judicial and administrative practice. Nor could it be argued that the domestic law contained any formal and explicit distinction between men and women.

Like the CEDAW Committee (see the Concluding Comments on the combined fourth and fifth periodic report of Turkey CEDAW/C/TUR/4</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">5 and Corr.1, 15 February 2005, §§</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">12-21), the Court welcomes the reforms carried out by the Government, particularly the adoption of Law no. 4320 which provides for specific measures for protection against domestic violence. It thus appears that the alleged discrimination at issue was not based on the legislation </span><span class="sA36B60A1">per se</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> but rather resulted from the general attitude of the local authorities, such as the manner in which the women were treated at police stations when they reported domestic violence and judicial passivity in providing effective protection to victims. The Court notes that the Turkish Government have already recognised these difficulties in practice when discussing the issue before the CEDAW Committee (ibid.).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">193.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In that regard, the Court notes that the applicant produced reports and statistics prepared by two leading NGOs, the Diyarbakır Bar Association and Amnesty International, with a view to demonstrating discrimination against women (see paragraphs 94-97 and 99-104 above). Bearing in mind that the findings and conclusions reached in these reports have not been challenged by the Government at any stage of the proceedings, the Court will consider them together with its own findings in the instant case (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">(dec.), no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;54861/00&quot;]}" target="_blank">54861/00</a>, 6</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">January 2005, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Zarb Adami</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> </span><span class="sA36B60A1">v.

The great majority of these women were of Kurdish origin, illiterate or of a low level of education and generally without any independent source of income (see paragraph 98 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">195.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, there appear to be serious problems in the implementation of Law no. 4320, which was relied on by the Government as one of the remedies for women facing domestic violence. The research conducted by the above-mentioned organisations indicates that when victims report domestic violence to police stations, police officers do not investigate their complaints but seek to assume the role of mediator by trying to convince the victims to return home and drop their complaint. In this connection, police officers consider the problem as a “family matter with which they cannot interfere” (see paragraphs 92, 96 and 102 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">196.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It also transpires from these reports that there are unreasonable delays in issuing injunctions by the courts, under Law no. 4320, because the courts treat them as a form of divorce action and not as an urgent action. Delays are also frequent when it comes to serving injunctions on the aggressors, given the negative attitude of the police officers (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">91-93, 95 and 101 above). Moreover, the perpetrators of domestic violence do not seem to receive dissuasive punishments, because the courts mitigate sentences on the grounds of custom, tradition or honour (see paragraphs 103 and 106 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">197.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As a result of these problems, the above-mentioned reports suggest that domestic violence is tolerated by the authorities and that the remedies indicated by the Government do not function effectively. Similar findings and concerns were expressed by the CEDAW Committee when it noted “the persistence of violence against women, including domestic violence, in Turkey” and called upon the respondent State to intensify its efforts to prevent and combat violence against women. It further underlined the need to fully implement and carefully monitor the effectiveness of Law no. 4320 on the protection of the family, and of related policies in order to prevent violence against women, to provide protection and support services to the victims, and punish and rehabilitate offenders (see the Concluding Comments, § 28).</span></p><p class="sD5DF731"><span class="sBB9EE52A">198.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the applicant has been able to show, supported by unchallenged statistical information, the existence of a prima facie indication that the domestic violence affected mainly women and that the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in Turkey created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence.</span></p><p class="s8378218E"><span class="s29100277">(c)</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Whether the applicant and her mother have been discriminated against on account of the authorities’ failure to provide equal protection of law</span></p><p class="s984A15CA"><span class="sBB9EE52A">199.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court has established that the criminal</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">law system, as operated in the instant case, did not have an adequate deterrent effect capable of ensuring the effective prevention of unlawful acts by H.O. against the personal integrity of the applicant and her mother and thus violated their rights under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">200.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Bearing in mind its finding above that the general and discriminatory judicial passivity in Turkey, albeit unintentional, mainly affected women, the Court considers that the violence suffered by the applicant and her mother may be regarded as gender-based violence which is a form of discrimination against women. Despite the reforms carried out by the Government in recent years, the overall unresponsiveness of the judicial system and impunity enjoyed by the aggressors, as found in the instant case, indicated that there was insufficient commitment to take appropriate action to address domestic violence (see, in particular, section 9 of the CEDAW Committee’s General Recommendation No. 19, cited at paragraph 74 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">201.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Taking into account the ineffectiveness of domestic remedies in providing equal protection of law to the applicant and her mother in the enjoyment of their rights guaranteed by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the Court holds that there existed special circumstances which absolved the applicant from her obligation to exhaust domestic remedies. It therefore dismisses the Government’s objection on non-exhaustion in respect of the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">202.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In view of the above, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Articles</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">2 and 3, in the instant case.</span></p><p class="s9F223FEE"><span class="sBB9EE52A">V.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 6 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION</span></p><p class="sE938989A"><span class="sBB9EE52A">203.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Relying on Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention, the applicant complained that the criminal proceedings brought against H.O. were ineffective and had failed to provide sufficient protection for her and her mother.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">204.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government contested that argument.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">205.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Having regard to the violations found under Articles 2, 3 and 14 of the Convention (see paragraphs 153, 176 and 202 above), the Court does not find it necessary to examine the same facts also in the context of Articles 6 and 13.</span></p><p class="s9F223FEE"><span class="sBB9EE52A">VI.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION</span></p><p class="s8E011338"><span class="sBB9EE52A">206.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Article 41 of the Convention provides:</span></p><p class="s56E27C8"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”</span></p><p class="s804EF768"><span class="s29100277">A.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Damage</span></p><p class="s87F05BA2"><span class="sBB9EE52A">207.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant claimed 70,000 Turkish liras (TRL) (approximately 35,000 euros (EUR)) in respect of pecuniary damage resulting from the death of her mother and TRL 250,000 (approximately EUR 125,000) for non</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">pecuniary damage. She explained that subsequent to the killing of her mother she had been deprived of any economic support from her. The killing of her mother and ongoing violence perpetrated by her former husband had caused her stress and anguish, as well as irreparable damage to her psychological well-being and self-esteem.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">208.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government submitted that the amounts claimed were not justified in the circumstances of the case.

However, this does not exclude an award in respect of pecuniary damage being made to an applicant who has established that a close member of the family has suffered a violation of the Convention (see </span><a name="File5" class="bookmark"><span class="sA36B60A1">Aksoy</span></a><span class="sA36B60A1"> v.

In the present case, however, the claims for pecuniary damage relate to alleged losses accruing subsequent to the death of the applicant’s mother. The Court is not convinced that the applicant’s mother incurred any losses before her death. Thus, the Court does not find it appropriate in the circumstances of this case to make any award to the applicant in respect of pecuniary damage.</span></p><p class="s11869A80"><span class="sBB9EE52A">210.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On the other hand, as regards the non-pecuniary damage, the Court notes that the applicant has undoubtedly suffered anguish and distress on account of the killing of her mother and the authorities’ failure to undertake sufficient measures to prevent the domestic violence perpetrated by her husband and to give him deterrent punishment. Ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 30,000 in respect of the damage sustained by her as a result of violations of Articles 2, 3 and 14 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s7EE1C8F0"><span class="s29100277">B.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Costs and expenses</span></p><p class="s87F05BA2"><span class="sBB9EE52A">211.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also claimed TRL 15,500 (approximately EUR</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">7,750) for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.
