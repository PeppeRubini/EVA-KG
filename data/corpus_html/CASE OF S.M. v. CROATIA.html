Afterwards she moved to live with her father in S. and occasionally visited her mother in Z.</span></p><ol type="I" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s5C381674"><span>The applicant’s criminal complaint and the ensuing investigation</span><ol type="A" class="s743F3A55"><li class="s37839E0D"><span>The applicant’s criminal complaint against T.M.</span></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">11.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 27 September 2012 the applicant came to a police station in Z. and on the record made a criminal complaint against a certain T.M. She alleged that during the summer of 2011 T.M. had physically and psychologically forced her into prostitution.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">12.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant submitted that sometime before the summer of 2011 T.M. had contacted her via Facebook and presented himself as a friend of her parents. Following this initial contact, for about a month or two she had continued exchanging messages with T.M. over everyday things. Then sometime in June or July 2011 she had met T.M. and went for a drink with him. On that occasion T.M. had explained that he wanted to help her with finding a job because he knew her parents. For that purpose T.M. left his phone number. Already on that occasion the applicant felt that T.M. was a person who insisted on having things his own way and who could not be contradicted.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">13.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant further stated that following this meeting she had continued exchanging messages with T.M. via Facebook. As she had had no reason to question T.M.’s intentions, about two weeks after the first meeting she had contacted T.M. and they had decided to meet again. This time when they met T.M. had said that he would take her to a man to whom she should provide sexual services for money. T.M. had explained that she should charge 400 Croatian kunas (HRK; approximately 50 euros (EUR)) for her services and that she should give him half of that money. She had told T.M. that she did not want to do this. T.M. had then said that she would only have to do this until he found her a proper job. As she had earlier realised that T.M. was not a person to whom one could say “no”, out of fear she had agreed to go with him to see the man.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">14.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">T.M. had then taken her in his car to a place in the proximity of Zap. (a city near Z.) where the man had been waiting for her in a house. The applicant had explained to the man what was happening and the man had not insisted on having intercourse with her but said that he would give her HRK 400. T.M. had listened to this conversation behind the door and, after the man had left the room, T.M. had slapped the applicant saying that she should never talk to clients and that she should listen to him and do only what he told her.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">15.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant further explained that after this incident, T.M. would pick her up every day in front of the place where she lived in Z. and he would take her in his car to provide sexual services to men who had answered an advertisement on a social network. After a while, he had given her a mobile telephone so that clients could contact her and had continued to drive her to meet clients in various places. Soon afterwards T.M. had rented a flat in Z. (the applicant provided the address) where she continued rendering sexual services to men. This arrangement had allowed T.M. to have her constantly under control as he had always been in the flat and had also said that he would install cameras so that he could know what was happening.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant had been afraid of T.M. as he had said that he had done the same thing with some other girls, whom he would physically punish if they did not listen to him. T.M. had also physically punished her when she opposed him over something. When she had refused to provide sexual services to other men, he had beaten her.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">16.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also stated that at the beginning of September 2011, when she knew that T.M. would be absent from the flat for a longer time, she had left the flat and gone to the house of her friend M.I. She explained to M.I. what had happened to her. After he had realised that she had left him, T.M. had at first started contacting her via Facebook asking her to come back and saying how he loved her and that she would never again have to provide sexual services. As the applicant had not answered these messages, T.M. had started threatening that he would find her and that she and her parents would “pay” for everything. The applicant had continued ignoring these messages so after a while T.M. had stopped sending them. A year later, and two weeks before the applicant lodged her criminal complaint, T.M. had again contacted her via Facebook mentioning her mother. All this had made the applicant feel frightened for her own safety and the safety of her parents and sister.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">17.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant finally explained that on average she had had one client per day because when T.M. had not been around she would turn off the phone and deactivate the advertisement so that clients could not contact her. In total she had some thirty clients and she had earned approximately HRK 13,000 (approximately EUR 1,700). Half of this amount she had given to T.M.</span></p><ol start="2" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>Preliminary police investigation</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">18.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On the same day when the applicant made her criminal complaint, the police informed the Z.

His criminal record, obtained by the State Attorney’s Office, indicated that in 2005 T.M. had been convicted of the offence of procuring prostitution using coercion, under Article 195 §§ 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 96 below) and rape under Article 188 § 1 of the Criminal Code, and that he had been sentenced to six and a half years’ imprisonment.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">21.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 10 October 2012 T.M. was arrested and questioned by the police.

He denied the allegations made by the applicant and stated that everything was an attempt by the applicant and her mother to take revenge on him for the difficult relationship he had had with the applicant’s mother.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">22.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 11 October 2012 the police sent the applicant’s criminal complaint and all the collected evidence to the State Attorney’s Office. The police classified the applicant’s complaint under Article 195 § 3 of the Criminal Code (procuring prostitution using coercion). T.M. was also brought before an investigating judge of the County Court who ordered his pre-trial detention. He remained in detention until the end of the criminal proceedings against him in the Municipal Court.</span></p><ol start="3" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>Investigation conducted by the State Attorney’s Office</span><ol type="1" class="s743F3A55"><li class="sC6C7C49B"><span>Questioning of T.M.</span></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">23.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 11 October 2012 T.M. was questioned in the State Attorney’s Office. He reiterated the arguments made during the police questioning. He also explained that the applicant had contacted him because she had asked him to protect her from another person for whom she was engaged in prostitution. T.M. denied that he had ever proposed to her that she engage in prostitution for him. He also stressed that the applicant had rented a flat in Z. and that he had lent her money for that, which she had later returned. T.M. further explained that at the applicant’s request he used to drive her around. However, she had not told him where she was going but he had suspected that she might be engaged in prostitution. T.M. stated that he had not lived with the applicant in the same flat. He would only sometimes stay overnight when she would invite him as they had had a relationship. T.M. admitted that once he might have hit the applicant but that was because she had provoked him. He denied that he had given her a mobile phone as she had had her own phone.</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s76334B44"><span>Questioning of the applicant</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">24.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 16 October 2012, in the context of the investigation against T.M., the applicant was questioned in the State Attorney’s Office. The applicant was informed of all her rights as a victim of an offence under Article 43 § 1, Article 45 and Article 52 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 98 below). She stated that she had understood the instructions and made no specific request in that regard.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">25.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">During the questioning, the applicant repeated her statement concerning the first contact she had had with T.M. (see paragraphs 12-13 above). She also explained that sometime in spring 2011 T.M. had started suggesting that he could find a job for her in a shopping mall. As she had been without employment, she had started communicating with him more intensively. In this context, she had met T.M. on various occasions in cafés and he had continued saying that he could find a job for her. She had had no reason to question his intentions.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">26.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also provided further details concerning the incident when T.M. had taken her to provide sexual services to a man in a house near Zap. She stated that it had happened at the beginning of July 2011 and that T.M. had taken her there by deceiving her into thinking that he would take her to a friend who could find her a job. The applicant repeated her statement as regards the events in the house and how the man had not insisted on sexual intercourse but had still paid her HRK 400. She also reiterated that T.M. had stormed into the room where she was with the man and started to shout at her, following which he had slapped her. Moreover, on their way to Z., T.M. had threatened to throw her out of the car on the highway because she had started asking what was happening.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">27.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant further explained that the next day T.M. had again contacted her and told her that they needed to talk about what had happened. She had agreed to meet him but they had not discussed what had happened as he had avoided the topic. A few days later T.M. had given her a mobile telephone. He had explained that clients seeking sexual services would contact her on that number. T.M. had also told the applicant that she had to give her physical description to men who would contact her and charge HRK</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">400 for half an hour of sexual services or HRK 600 (approximately EUR 80) for an hour, and that she had to give half of that money to T.M. The applicant had acquiesced to all that because she had been scared that T.M. would attack her again and that he would tell her parents everything that was happening.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">28.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also submitted that the men who would contact her had explained that they had seen the advertisement on the Internet. Some ten days after the incident in Zap., T.M. had rented a flat (the applicant provided the address), where the applicant and T.M. had then lived together. She had provided sexual services in that flat and sometimes T.M. had driven her to clients. Since T.M. had lived in the same flat with her, he had controlled everything she did. When she had refused to have sexual intercourse with other men or with him or when she had talked to the clients, T.M. had beaten her. He had beaten her every couple of days. She repeated the statement concerning the amount of money she had earned and stressed that she had given half of it to T.M.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">29.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Asked as to why she had not contacted the police earlier, the applicant answered that she had been afraid of T.M. and that he had had her under his control. However, once, when T.M. had been out of the flat and had left the key, she had called her friend M.I. and asked her for help. M.I. had known that she had been giving sexual services to men for money against her will and that she had been in trouble. After this discussion, M.I.’s boyfriend, T., had arrived by taxi, helped the applicant to collect her things and taken her to M.I.’s home, where she had then stayed for several days.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">30.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant further said that after she had left, T.M. had at first started contacting her via Facebook asking her to come back to him and telling her that he loved her. As the applicant had not answered these messages, T.M. had started threatening that he would tell everything she had done to her parents. She had truly been afraid that he might do that so she had decided to lodge a criminal complaint to put an end to everything that had happened.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">31.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also said that T.M. had told her that he had previously had a girlfriend, A., whom he had treated in the same way as the applicant. She had also learned from Facebook that T.M. had later had another girlfriend who had been engaged in prostitution. T.M. had told the applicant that he had filmed those girlfriends and punished them when they had been insolent. He had also threatened to do the same thing to the applicant. T.M. had told her all that in order to break her will to stand up to him.</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s76334B44"><span>Questioning of M.I.</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">32.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 6 November 2012 the State Attorney’s Office questioned M.I. She said that the applicant was her friend and she had known her for some two years. M.I.’s last contact with the applicant (before the applicant had come to her flat) had been some eight or nine months previously.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">33.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">M.I. explained that at the end of summer 2011 the applicant had suddenly come to her home with a bag containing her things. M.I. had then learned that the applicant had agreed with M.I.’s mother that she would come to stay with them, but she (M.I.) did not know any details since she was not on very good terms with her mother. Also, M.I.’s boyfriend (whose full name and address she gave) had told her that he had spoken to the applicant. However, soon afterwards M.I. had broken up with her boyfriend so they had not discussed any details concerning his contact with the applicant.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">34.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">M.I. further stated that the applicant had told her about T.M., from whom she had escaped because she had no longer wished to be involved in prostitution for him. Before the applicant had come to her flat, M.I. had known that the applicant was engaged in prostitution but she had not known where or for whom the applicant was doing this. Only then had M.I. learned that the applicant had being doing it for T.M. According to M.I., the applicant had been very distressed and scared. She had told M.I. that T.M. had repeatedly beaten her, had watched her through a key hole when she had been giving sexual services to clients and afterwards had also beaten her for not being in a position he had approved of.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">35.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">M.I. also said that she understood that the applicant had voluntarily given sexual services because she had needed money. The applicant had told her that she had had an agreement with T.M. to work for him and to share the money, that she had had a mobile telephone for clients to call her and that there had been a small ad through which she had been contacted for appointments by clients. The applicant had said that T.M. had given her that mobile telephone and placed the advertisement.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">36.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">M.I. further stated that she could not remember if the applicant had told her that she had resisted T.M. It was true that the applicant had said that she had not wished to “do it” but in M.I.’s understanding that had rather meant that the applicant had been “doing it” because she had had no other means to earn money. The applicant had also told her that T.M. had slapped her for very minor reasons which she (the applicant) had not expected. The applicant had also said to M.I. that when she had refused sexual relations with him T.M. would beat her and the applicant had not known what would make him explode again. According to M.I.’s knowledge, T.M. had also told the applicant that he had had another girlfriend whom he had treated in the same way as the applicant. The applicant told M.I. that she had used the opportunity to run away from T.M. when he had been out of the flat where they had lived.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">37.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">M.I. also said that the applicant had stayed with her and her mother for more than half a year and that T.M. had continued to contact the applicant through Facebook. M.I. had seen the messages that he had sent and they were threatening to the applicant and the applicant’s mother. He had also sent messages saying that he loved her and asking her to come back to him.</span></p><ol start="4" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>The indictment against T.M.</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">38.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 6 November 2012 the State Attorney’s Office indicted T.M. in the Z. Municipal Criminal Court (hereinafter “the Municipal Court”) on charges of procuring prostitution using coercion, as an aggravated offence of procuring prostitution, proscribed by Article 195 § 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 96 below).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">39.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The indictment alleged that T.M., in order to obtain pecuniary gain, had deceived the applicant into believing that he would find her a job. However, after that he had taken her to provide sexual services to a man in Zap. As the applicant had refused to do that, T.M. had hit her and then, on their way back to Z., had threatened to throw her out of the car. Soon afterwards T.M. had provided the applicant with a mobile phone to answer the clients’ calls. He had also instructed her how to charge for sexual services and to give half of the money to him. According to the indictment, the applicant had consented to this out of fear. T.M. had then taken the applicant to the addresses of clients where she had provided sexual services for money and after a while he had rented a flat in Z. where the applicant had continued providing sexual services to a number of men. T.M. had kept the applicant under surveillance and had also told her that he had beaten other girls who did not do what he had requested. When the applicant resisted him saying that she did not want to provide sexual services anymore, T.M. would hit her. She had therefore, out of fear of him, continued providing sexual services to men for money until September 2011, when she had run away from the flat.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">40.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The indictment relied on the applicant’s statement and considered that it was corroborated by M.I.’s evidence. The indictment also considered that T.M.’s defence, although denying the commission of the offence, essentially made the applicant’s statement even stronger.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">41.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 22 November 2012 a three-judge panel of the Municipal Court confirmed the indictment and sent the case for trial.</span></p><ol start="2" type="I" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s5C381674"><span>Criminal proceedings against T.M.</span><ol type="A" class="s743F3A55"><li class="s37839E0D"><span>First hearing</span></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">42.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The first hearing before the Municipal Court scheduled for 12</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">December 2012 was adjourned because T.M. claimed to be on hunger strike and could not therefore participate in the proceedings. The judge conducting the proceedings commissioned an expert report to establish whether T.M. could participate in the trial.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">43.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The expert report established that T.M. had worked as a policeman for a number of years and that he had been a member of the special police forces during the war in Croatia in the 1990s. He had retired from the police in 2001. He suffered from a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to his participation in the war and he had also developed a personality disorder. He had received psychiatric treatment over a number of years. According to the report, T.M.’s capacity to understand the nature of the impugned acts had been diminished but not to a significant degree. The report therefore recommended that, in the event of conviction, an order for mandatory psychiatric treatment be made. The report also considered that T.M. could participate in and follow the proceedings.</span></p><ol start="2" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>Second hearing (T.M.’s defence pleading)</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">44.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">At a hearing on 14 January 2013 T.M. pleaded not guilty. He denied that he had forced the applicant into prostitution. He confirmed that he had contacted the applicant through Facebook because he had recognised her surname since he had known her mother. After several exchanges of messages via Facebook, T.M. and the applicant had started to see each other and the applicant had told him that she had had no money and needed a job and that she had some debts. She had also said that she was in fear of a certain B., whom T.M. had known from prison and it had therefore been clear to him “what the applicant was doing”. Moreover, she had said that she had kept contact details of her clients which she had obtained from B. The applicant had also asked T.M. to lend her money to rent a flat, which he had done and she had later returned the amount she had borrowed in two instalments. The applicant had also said that she would try to find a job.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">45.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">T.M. further stated that a few weeks after he had met the applicant, they had engaged in a relationship. The applicant had asked him to take her to certain addresses by car and on five or six occasions he had done so. He had known that she was going there to give sexual services for money. However, he had not known how much she had been earning from the provision of her services. T.M. confirmed that he had once hit the applicant because they had had a disagreement over “work” and she had provoked him. He specified that this concerned the fact that the applicant had said that she had found a job in a bakery but that she did not want to work. T.M. had not liked her attitude so there had been an argument and, as he had not been able to control himself, he had hit her. Later on, he had found a job for the applicant in a restaurant in Zap. but then she had disappeared. This had happened in August 2011 and the only thing he had found in the flat she had rented had been a message from the owner of the flat addressed to the applicant.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">46.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by the judge conducting the proceedings, T.M. explained that he had not lived with the applicant in the flat she had rented but only sometimes spent the night there. He had had the keys of the flat. Sometimes the applicant would go alone to see her clients or to see a doctor or her friends, and she would later inform T.M. that she had some money. T.M. could not explain why he had agreed to the applicant providing sexual services to other men when he had been in a relationship with her. He stressed that she had wanted to be independent and to earn her own money so he had not wanted to interfere in that. He also explained that he had only used one mobile phone and that those found by the police during the search had been his old phones which he had no longer used.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">47.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by the prosecutor, T.M. denied that he had given any mobile phone to the applicant. According to him, she had had her own two mobile phones. T.M. also stated that on two or three occasions the applicant had given him some money for fuel because he had driven her around. However, she had constantly complained that she had no money so he used to give her money as well. T.M.’s impression was not that the applicant had been afraid of him as she had not been the kind of person to be afraid of anybody.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">48.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Following T.M.’s questioning, the prosecutor asked that the applicant and M.I. be heard as witnesses.

In this connection, she explained that before the incident in Zap. she had met T.M. three or four times for a coffee and they had exchanged messages on Facebook. He had promised to do his best to find her a job as a waitress or in a shop. The applicant further clarified that when T.M. had taken her to see the man in Zap., he had said that they would have a coffee with him. In the house, the man had seen T.M. slapping her. With regard to the events that happened on their way back to Z., the applicant explained that she had wanted to run away from T.M. but that he had managed to catch her and had forced her to stay in the car. The next day when they had met they had not talked about these events but about her attempts to find a job. The applicant also explained that she had agreed to move into the flat which T.M. had found without him using any force on her. She had done that in order to protect her roommate with whom she had lived at the time. T.M. had commented on how good-looking she was and the applicant had tried to avoid getting her in any of these things and to end up like she (the applicant) did.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">53.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by the judge conducting the proceedings, the applicant explained that when T.M. had rented the flat for her she could guess what she was expected to do there, namely to provide sexual services. She had been afraid of him and for that reason had agreed to give sexual services to other men. He had also threatened that he would tell everything to her parents and that he would put her mother in prison. The applicant also repeated her statement from the investigation about the number of clients she had had and the money she had earned, half of which she had given to T.M.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">54.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant further stated that T.M. had been present in the flat when she had provided sexual services to other men. Sometimes he had watched her through the keyhole and he would slap her if she refused to be with a client or to have the intercourse in the way T.M. had wanted. She had also been forced to have sex with T.M. She had not sought medical help or contacted the police because she could not get out of the flat.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">55.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When further questioned by the judge conducting the proceedings, the applicant said that she had not known T.M.’s background when they had first got in touch. At that time, he had known that she had no job and he had promised to try to find her one. As to the incident in Zap., the applicant repeated her statement from the investigation. She explained that she had voluntarily given the money she had received from the man to T.M.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">56.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also explained that she had accepted the mobile phones which T.M. had procured for the contacts with clients because she had been afraid of him. Later on, while no longer living in the flat which T.M. had rented, the applicant had learned from T.M. that her mother had previously reported him (the applicant did not specify for what) and that he had been in prison. The applicant also stated that it was she alone who had answered the clients’ calls. Clients would sometimes come to the flat or T.M. would drive her to meet them. In the flat, she had lived with T.M. although she had been required to pay rent, and she had done so. She had not had keys to the flat. She had had one mobile phone which T.M. had provided and she had her own mobile phone but did not have money on the pre-paid SIM card. She had stayed in the flat for about a month and a half. She had not tried to run away because she had been afraid of T.M. She had also not tried to contact the police because T.M. had said that he had contacts in the police and that he would very quickly learn if she had reported him.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">57.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards her escape from the flat, the applicant explained that once she had taken advantage of the fact that T.M. had been absent for a while and that the key had been left in the front door. She had then called her friend M.I., with whom she had been in contact over the Internet some fifteen days before when she had told M.I. that she was in trouble and that she would need her help. On the occasion when she had called M.I., the applicant had spoken to M.I. and her mother. She had not explained any details but had simply said that she was staying with a man in a flat and was engaged in prostitution and that she wanted to escape. The agreement was that M.I.’s now former boyfriend T. would come by taxi to pick her up. The applicant explained that she had had some earlier contacts with T. via Facebook but she had not told him anything about her situation. When T. had taken her to M.I.’s place, the applicant had found M.I. and her mother there. She had stayed with them for about ten days and she had told M.I. what she had been through. Meanwhile, she had also had contact with the owner of the flat where she had stayed with T.M. concerning the rent and how she could get some of her belongings that she had left there.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">58.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Further to the judge’s questions, the applicant explained that she had not tried to escape from T.M. when he took her to see clients away from the flat because she had been sure that he would find her and he had strictly controlled the time she spent with clients. The applicant also stated that T.M. had told her that he had done the same thing to another girl. When confronted with T.M.’s defence, the applicant denied that T.M. had ever lent her money to pay her rent. She said that she did not know any person by the name of B. and denied that she had had any contact details of clients. She also stated that T.M. had never told her that he had found her a job in the restaurant in Zap. Later on, when she had already left him, he had sent her some messages via Facebook mentioning that he had found her a job in a shop.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">59.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also stated that at first when she had run away from T.M. she had not wanted to report him to the police. However, after she had left, T.M. had continued contacting her via Facebook, had reported to the authorities that her mother had neglected and abused her younger daughter, and had threatened that as soon as she found a job or continued with her education he would destroy everything for her. She had therefore decided to report him to the police. The applicant also explained that after she had left T.M. she had been afraid to go out in public and felt fear every time she saw a car similar to T.M.’s.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">60.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by the prosecutor, the applicant stated that she had been very afraid of T.M. She had never known how he would react and she had been in fear for her life because he used to threaten that he would beat her to death. Also, when she had refused to have sex with him, he would beat her. He had also beaten her when she said that she did not want to provide sexual services anymore. Moreover, he had deceived her by saying that she would have to provide sexual services only for a few days and that he would find her a proper job. As to the sharing of money, the applicant explained that she would first hand over all the money she had collected from a client to T.M. and he would then give part of it to her. T.M. had also set some rules concerning the way she was allowed to provide sexual services. When she did not obey this or if she gave sexual services in a manner that he did not like, he would then beat her. He had also taken photos of her naked and published them with the ad. She had not objected to him taking the photos because she had been scared. Then, he had threatened to show the photos to her parents.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">61.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by her lawyer, the applicant stated that T.M. had at first presented himself to her as a former policeman and said that he had been in the war with her father. Later on he had said that he knew people in every police station and that he would “frame” her if she tried to report him.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">62.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by the defence lawyer, the applicant stated that following her first contact with T.M. she had not tried to get in touch with her mother to check whether she had known him. At that time, her mother had not lived in Croatia and they had not been on good terms. However, she had then exchanged some messages with her mother, who had simply said that T.M. was not a reliable person. The applicant had also asked her father about T.M. and he had said that T.M. was “an okay person”. The applicant had concluded from the messages which she had exchanged with T.M. that he was not a bad person and she had no reason to call into question his statement that he had been a policeman. Later on, after she had left T.M., the applicant had spoken to her mother about him. Her mother had told her that she had lived with T.M. after she had split from the applicant’s father. When the applicant asked her mother why T.M. was angry with her and why she had reported him (it was not specified in the record for what), her mother had said that it had not been her but another girl who had reported him and that this girl had provided sexual services in the same manner as the applicant did. According to the applicant, that was the same girl about whom T.M. had also spoken to her.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">63.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When further questioned by the defence lawyer, the applicant explained that when she had gone to pick up her belongings from the flat where she had lived with T.M., the owner of the flat and M.I. had been there with her. She had been contacted by the owner as she had not paid the last rent. The flat had been rented in her name. During her stay in the flat with T.M. the owner used to come and T.M. would present them as a couple to the owner. The applicant also stated that T.M. had slept every night in the flat. She did not deny that there had been moments when she would leave the flat to go to a shop without T.M. It had happened three or four times during the period of a month and a half. However, she had not dared to run away because of her fear of T.M., who had always watched her from the window.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">64.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">After the applicant’s questioning, T.M. was brought back to the courtroom and her statement was read out to him. He had no questions and made a general objection as to the credibility of her statement.</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s76334B44"><span>M.I.’s oral evidence</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">65.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The trial court then proceeded to the questioning of M.I. She repeated her statement given during the investigation (see paragraphs 32-37 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">66.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by the judge conducting the proceedings, and after being presented with the applicant’s statement, M.I. denied that the applicant had called her when she had left T.M. She insisted that the applicant must have arranged everything with her (M.I.’s) mother. M.I. further stated that she had known from before that the applicant was engaged in prostitution because the applicant had told her so. The applicant had explained to M.I. that she needed money and that she was living without parents. M.I. considered that the applicant had initially engaged in prostitution voluntarily. M.I.’s opinion was that the applicant had also voluntarily engaged in the prostitution ring with T.M. because she had needed money. However, the applicant had not known who she was dealing with given that – as M.I. had learned from the applicant – T.M. had forced and beaten her. M.I. could not remember whether the applicant had told her that she had resisted T.M. when he had asked her to provide sexual services to men. The applicant had told M.I. that she did not want to do these things anymore but M.I. had understood that as a general complaint about the fact that she had to earn money in this way.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">67.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When further questioned by the judge conducting the proceedings, M.I. stated that the applicant had stayed for several months with her. When she had come to M.I.’s place, the applicant had not had any visible injuries but had been very scared and upset. She had been in fear of T.M. and had said that she could not believe what had happened to her and that she had not expected that. M.I. also explained that she had seen the Facebook messages which T.M. had sent to the applicant on the applicant’s laptop. They had been long messages in which T.M. had sometimes said how he loved the applicant and sometimes had made threats mentioning the applicant and her mother. M.I. denied that she had gone with the applicant to pick up her belongings in the flat where she had lived with T.M. According to M.I., it had been her boyfriend T. who had gone with the applicant to the flat.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">68.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by the defence lawyer, M.I. stated that the applicant had never mentioned to her a person by the name of B. She also said that at about the time when the applicant had come to her place she was about to break up with her boyfriend T. As far as M.I. knew, at the relevant time T. had only once exchanged a message with the applicant via Facebook.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">69.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Following M.I.’s questioning, the applicant stated that she had no objections to M.I.’s evidence. The applicant considered that, although there had been some discrepancies in their statements, this was the result of the peculiar course of events.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">70.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">After hearing the applicant and M.I., the prosecutor proposed that the materials from the file be allowed as evidence. The defence asked that a certain K.Z. be heard as a witness concerning the threats of revenge that the applicant’s mother had allegedly made towards T.M. The defence also asked that T.M.’s brother be heard as a witness.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">71.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The prosecution opposed these proposals and the trial court considered that it was not necessary to take the evidence proposed by the defence. The next hearing was scheduled for 15 February 2013.</span></p><ol start="4" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>Closing hearing (T.M.’s closing statement)</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">72.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">At the hearing on 15 February 2013 the applicant was represented by the lawyer provided by the Rosa Centre. T.M. asked the trial court to allow him to make a further statement, which the trial court agreed to.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">73.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In his statement, T.M. stated that he knew the applicant’s mother because she had also been a prostitute but had lost touch with her when he had started serving his prison sentence. After he had made contact with the applicant via Facebook, the applicant had told him that she had talked to her mother about him. He had wanted to help the applicant to find a job and she had also told him that she was engaged in prostitution because that had been the easiest way to earn money. He had fallen in love with the applicant and wanted to have a relationship with her. He had agreed that she could continue with the prostitution because he was not a jealous person. However, he had told her that she should get a proper job.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">74.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">T.M. further stated that it was the applicant who had rented the flat and organised everything. He knew that she had charged HRK 400 for half an hour and HRK 600 for an hour but it had been her, not him, who had set that price. He had not constantly stayed in the flat. He also denied that the incident in Zap., as stated in the indictment, had ever happened.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">75.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When questioned by the judge conducting the proceedings, T.M. admitted that sometimes he had been in the flat when the applicant had provided sexual services to men and that he had received half of the money which she had charged for her services. He had not wanted to take the money but the applicant had insisted saying that it was for the fuel that he had used when driving her to meet clients away from the flat. T.M. also denied that he had strictly controlled the time the applicant had spent with her clients. However, he admitted that he had given her money to buy a mobile phone but that was because she had asked for it. According to T.M., the applicant could have left the flat whenever she wished. However, he had been surprised to see that one day she had simply left. He assumed that the reason for that was the fact that he had put pressure on her to find a proper job and had even made certain contacts to arrange job interviews for her. T.M. admitted that he had hit the applicant once but the reason had again been related to his insistence that she find a proper job. T.M. also stated that he had not known how many clients the applicant had had in total. He had not always been with her and had not constantly controlled her. He denied any deception or force towards the applicant related to her provision of sexual services.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">76.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">When asked by the applicant’s lawyer why the applicant needed him at all when she had arranged everything on her own, T.M. refused to answer that question saying that he had already explained everything concerning their relationship.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">77.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">After hearing T.M.’s further statement, the parties made no further proposals for the taking of evidence. The judge conducting the proceedings admitted the documents provided by the prosecution as evidence, heard the parties’ and the applicant’s lawyer’s closing statements and concluded the proceedings.</span></p><ol start="5" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s6973D569"><span>The judgment</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">78.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Following the hearing of 15 February 2013 the Municipal Court acquitted T.M. on the grounds that although it had been established that he had organised a prostitution ring into which he had recruited the applicant, it had not been established that he had forced or pressured her into prostitution, which was a constituent element of the offence he was charged with under Article 195 § 3 of the Criminal Code. In finding this, the court in particular noted the following:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“On the basis of the evidence given by the accused and the victim in these criminal proceedings the following facts have been established: that the accused and the victim met through the social network Facebook when the accused contacted the victim; that the accused had known the victim’s mother and father from before; that after the initial contact, the contacts continued in that the accused and the victim met in cafés in Z.; that at the time the victim lived in a rented flat with a friend K.; that she voluntarily, and at the invitation of the accused, moved to [another] flat in Z.; that she lived in that flat together with the accused for about month or month and a half. There is also no doubt that the accused gave a mobile telephone to the victim so that she could be contacted by the clients with whom she discussed providing sexual services; that the victim indeed did provide sexual services in the flat where she lived with the accused; that on five or six occasions the accused drove the victim to the addresses of clients where she provided sexual services; that the victim charged for providing sexual services the sum of HRK 400 for half an hour and the sum of HRK 600 for an hour. Moreover, there is no doubt that on one occasion the victim left the flat where she lived with the accused and went to her friend M.I.</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, it remains to be established whether the accused forced the victim to provide sexual services – which she undoubtedly provided – by the use of force or threat of the use of force or by deception, in order to obtain pecuniary gain.”</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">79.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In reaching the above conclusion, the Municipal Court noted that the decisive evidence on which the indictment was based was the applicant’s witness statement. However, the Municipal Court considered that it could not give sufficient weight to the applicant’s testimony because her statement had been incoherent, in places illogical and contrary to the evidence given by the witness M.I. and also by T.M. in his defence. Moreover, she had been unsure and had paused and hesitated when speaking. On the other hand, the Municipal Court considered that it could rely on the evidence given by M.I. and that it could generally accept T.M.’s defence, despite the fact that he had changed his statement during the proceedings. The court also considered that T.M.’s denial of the use of any coercion against the applicant was confirmed by the evidence given by M.I. as regards her knowledge of the applicant’s previous life and the circumstances in which she had engaged in prostitution for T.M.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">80.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 26 March 2013 the State Attorney’s Office lodged an appeal against the first-instance judgment with the County Court. It argued that the first-instance court had erred in its factual findings concerning the charges against T.M. in not accepting the applicant’s testimony. The State Attorney’s Office considered that her statement had been coherent, credible, logical and convincing, given that in all relevant parts she had provided a consistent account of the manner in which T.M. had forced her into prostitution. It also considered that T.M.’s statement could not be taken as credible and stressed that M.I. did not have direct knowledge of the relevant facts of the case.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">81.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 21</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">January 2014 the County Court dismissed the appeal of the State Attorney’s Office and upheld the first-instance judgment, endorsing the reasoning as well as the facts as established by the Municipal Court.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">82.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The County Court’s judgment was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 28 February 2014.</span></p><ol start="3" type="I" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s5C381674"><span>Proceedings before the Constitutional Court</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">83.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 31 March 2014 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court, complaining about the manner in which the criminal-law mechanisms had been applied in her case.

However, in the period between 17 January 2013 and 24 April 2015 the applicant contacted the Red Cross on several occasions. She received psycho-social support through individual counselling and material support. On two occasions the Red Cross also organised a dental examination for the applicant, as well as individual counselling with a psychologist.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">88.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Further to this the applicant was provided with legal aid by the non-governmental organisation the Rosa Centre (see paragraph 50 above), whose activities in the field of human trafficking were in part supported by the State.</span></p><ol start="5" type="I" class="s6B505E72"><li class="s5C381674"><span>Other relevant facts</span><ol type="A" class="s743F3A55"><li class="s37839E0D"><span>Complaint concerning the criminal proceedings against T.M.</span></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">89.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 13 March 2013 the non-governmental organisation the Rosa Centre complained to the Human Rights Office that the State Attorney’s Office had not pursued the applicant’s case diligently by collecting and presenting evidence capable of elucidating all the circumstances of the case. In this connection, the Rosa Centre stressed that there had been some inconsistencies in the statements of the applicant and the witness M.I., which required further clarification. It also submitted that the applicant had later explained that certain inconsistencies in her statement had been the result of her wish to protect other persons, namely her roommate, her friend M.I. and her mother.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">90.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Rosa Centre further argued that the trial court, which had not been bound by the prosecution’s legal classification of the facts, had not reclassified the charges to the basic form of procuring prostitution under Article 195 § 2 and convicted T.M. of that offence. The Rosa Centre also suggested that after the hearing, in an informal context, the judge conducting the proceedings had said to its lawyer that probably eighty percent of his colleagues would have convicted T.M. but that he had not considered that T.M. should be convicted as charged by the State Attorney’s Office. On that occasion, the judge had also stated that the State Attorney’s Office should have amended the indictment.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">91.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Human Rights Office forwarded this letter to the State Attorney General’s Office and asked for the relevant explanations.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">92.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In its report of 14 May 2013 the competent State Attorney’s Office explained that it had considered the applicant’s statement to be credible and convincing, and that it provided sufficient grounds for T.M.’s conviction under Article 195 § 3 of the Criminal Code. However, the Municipal Court had not agreed with this assessment and had acquitted T.M. The State Attorney’s Office still believed that the classification of procuring prostitution using coercion was appropriate and it had therefore lodged an appeal against the first-instance judgment (see paragraph 80 above). In these circumstances, it did not consider that it should have amended the indictment.

While they may be experienced in law enforcement in general, they may not have specific expertise in trafficking in persons; for this reason, the Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of ensuring that they are given appropriate training to identify victims of trafficking accurately and with sensitivity.</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">...</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">57.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Proactive investigations that seek to collect evidence to obviate or support victim testimony are another way for States to realize their due diligence obligation to prosecute trafficking without unduly burdening victims. The Special Rapporteur notes that alternative or corroborative evidence may be difficult to collect in trafficking cases because of limited resources and a lack of trained officials, particularly in States most affected by trafficking. The situation may also be compounded by the hidden nature of the crime and the lack of concrete records or indicators of criminal activity. It is important to acknowledge that substituting victim testimony with alternative evidence may not allow for full and effective prosecution. Nevertheless, the added value of such evidence merits attention, not least because the discovery of additional or corroborative evidence may alleviate some of the pressure put on victims during the prosecution process.”</span></p><ol start="2" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>International Labour Organisation (“the ILO”)</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">139.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The ILO has adopted two conventions on forced labour, namely the 1930 Forced Labour Convention (“Convention No. 29”) and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labour Convention (“Convention No. 105”), which were ratified by Croatia on 8 October 1991 and 5 March 1997 respectively.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">140.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In 2014 two new instruments were adopted by the ILO with a view to providing a comprehensive strategy against all forms of forced labour, including trafficking in persons, namely the Protocol to Convention No. 29 and Recommendation 203 on Supplementary Measures for the Effective Suppression of Forced Labour.</span></p><ol type="1" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sBA1F0987"><a name="_Toc5719631" class="bookmark"><span>Forced or compulsory labour according to Convention No.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>29</span></a></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">141.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Convention No. 29 requires ratifying States to suppress all forms of forced or compulsory labour.

The “penalty” may also consist of a loss of rights or privileges; and (iii) involuntariness – the term “offered voluntarily” refer to the free and informed consent of a worker to enter into an employment relationship and his or her freedom to leave the employment at any time.

the following:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“Increasing the number of investigations and prosecutions is one of the key priorities of the EU legal and policy framework addressing trafficking in human beings. However, it is also one of the key challenges reported by the Member States. In fact, trafficking in human beings is a crime often difficult and costly to detect and investigate. The investigations in this field require a substantial body of evidence in order to reach a conviction. In particular, practitioners note that excessive burden is placed on victims and their testimonies both before and during criminal proceedings for evidence gathering, while, according to the Anti-trafficking Directive, investigative tools and approaches should ensure that victims, either acting as witness or not, are not burdened excessively during procedures that can cause secondary trauma to them ...</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Based on the previous Eurostat data and the latest data transmitted by the Member States for the Report, the level of prosecutions and convictions remains worryingly low, especially when compared to the number of victims identified. This trend has been also confirmed by the GRETA reports, concluding that there is an important gap between the number of identified victims of trafficking and the number of convictions, and referring to several factors such as over-reliance on victims’ statements, issues around the credibility of witnesses who may change their statements over time, difficulties in relation to the sufficiency of evidence, or non-specialised and prejudiced investigators, prosecutors and judges ...</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">One of the main factors reported by Member States [contributing to the low level of prosecution] is related to the high evidentiary threshold applied by national courts, which leads to qualify cases of trafficking in human beings as crimes of lesser degree – such as procuring or pandering instead of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, or breach of labour laws or fraud instead of trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation – resulting in minor convictions.”</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">207.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In its second report on the progress made in the fight against trafficking in human beings dated 3 December 2018, the Commission noted, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">inter alia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, the following:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“Trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation continues to be the most reported form. In 2015-2016, there were 9 759 registered victims of sexual exploitation. i.e. over half (56%) of the registered victims who had a recorded form of exploitation, predominantly women and girls (95% of registered victims of sexual exploitation).</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">...</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Internal trafficking, within the territory of a Member State, is reported to be on the increase.</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Member States report that traffickers are constantly changing the ways they work, using less physical force but more psychological and emotional violence.</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">...</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">In view of the ever-adjusting methods used by traffickers, Member States should ensure specialised training for professionals likely to come in contact with victims, which is adapted to the role of new information technologies, and initiatives to prevent trafficking in human beings.</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">...</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Nevertheless, trafficking in human beings remains a crime characterised by impunity for the perpetrators and those who exploit the victims. The findings of this report do not indicate that trafficking has decreased. Further, the analysis of the data reveals a tendency to identify victims of prioritised forms of exploitation, with certain categories of victims placed at the forefront of action, while others receive less attention. Information from the Member States reveals persisting complexities and a lack of progress in key areas.

However, this does not prevent an applicant from clarifying or elaborating upon his or her initial submissions during the Convention proceedings. The Court has to take account not only of the original application but also of the additional documents intended to complete the latter by eliminating any initial omissions or obscurities.

The applicant also briefly explained the course of the domestic proceedings, which had eventually led to T.M.’s acquittal due to the fact that the domestic courts had not found that he had forced her into prostitution. In the light of these facts – albeit not set out in a completely coherent manner – the applicant raised an issue of the State’s procedural obligation complaining, in particular, of impunity for the acts of abuse to which T.M. had allegedly subjected her. She stressed that it was the State’s responsibility to investigate criminal acts and subsequently to conduct proceedings against the relevant individuals and, if they were found guilty, to punish them in accordance with the law. In her view, this meant that the State must put in place an effective criminal justice system. The applicant further argued that if the domestic courts had considered that T.M. had not forced her into prostitution, they should have convicted him at least of the procuring of prostitution under the relevant domestic law. The applicant also complained of a lack of appropriate assistance provided to her as a victim during the proceedings. Lastly, the applicant argued that procuring prostitution, as a form of gender-based violence, should not go unpunished. The applicant relied on Articles 3, 6, 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">221.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On 9 February 2015 the Government were given notice of the applicant’s complaints, in so far as relevant and admissible, under Articles</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">3, 4 and 8 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">222.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In her further submissions before the Chamber, the applicant stressed the authorities’ procedural obligation under the Convention. She also argued that her allegations of forced prostitution before the domestic authorities had been justified. Also, in reply to the Government’s submission, she elaborated on the domestic legal framework and argued that it was inadequate to address the problem of human trafficking. Moreover, in her view, the relevant domestic authorities had failed to recognise her case as human trafficking and had erroneously subsumed her allegations under a provision relating to forced prostitution. In particular, she argued that T.M. should have been prosecuted and convicted for human trafficking under Article 175 of the Criminal Code. In any event, in her view, even if he had been erroneously prosecuted for procuring prostitution using coercion under Article 195 § 3 of the Criminal Code (and not human trafficking), after the domestic courts had found the element of coercion not to be established they should have convicted him at least under Article 195 § 2 of the Criminal Code (procuring of prostitution). The fact that T.M. had eventually been acquitted showed, in the applicant’s view, the lack of an effective application of the criminal-law mechanisms in her case. The applicant also insisted that she had not been provided with adequate assistance or with the possibility of participating effectively in the proceedings as a victim of human trafficking.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">223.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On the basis of the above submissions, the Chamber declared the communicated complaints (Articles 3, 4 and 8) admissible but examined the case under Article 4 of the Convention only (see paragraph 36 and the first operative provision of the Chamber judgment; see also paragraphs 244-49 below).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">224.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Having regard to the above circumstances, the Court is of the view that there is no reason for it to decline jurisdiction in respect of the complaints declared admissible by the Chamber.

Having regard to the case taken as a whole, the Court finds that the factual elements of the applicant’s initial complaint and their elaboration in the applicant’s further submissions (see paragraphs 220 and 222 above) are sufficiently broad to cover different aspects of the domestic authorities’ procedural obligation to apply the relevant criminal-law mechanisms effectively.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">226.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Indeed, according to the Court’s case-law, impunity may derive from different causes. In particular, in so far as relevant for the present case, it may result from the failures of the relevant prosecuting authorities and criminal courts effectively to elucidate and address all the (often subtle) elements of conduct contrary to the Convention (see, for instance, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Chowdury and Others v.

It finds that the “scope” of the case before it, in terms of its legal characterisation, raises legal issues under Articles 3, 4 and 8 of the Convention. As to the factual scope of the case, the Court notes that the applicant’s complaint raises issues of alleged impunity for human trafficking, forced or alternatively non-forced prostitution relating to a deficient application of the relevant criminal-law mechanisms. It is thus essentially of a procedural nature. This finding, as already stressed above, is without prejudice to the further assessment and conclusion as to the actual applicability and scope of protection guaranteed under the Convention for the acts complained of by the applicant.</span></p><ol start="2" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>Preliminary objections on admissibility</span><ol type="1" class="s743F3A55"><li class="sB393C677"><span>The parties’ submissions</span></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s71EEDCF9"><span class="s29100277">(a)</span><span class="s30C8A987">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">The Government</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">230.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government argued that the application was inadmissible under Article 35 of the Convention. They contended that Article 4 was inapplicable in the present case and that, in any event, the applicant’s complaint should be declared inadmissible as it concerned an issue of outcome, where the Court’s power of review was limited.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">231.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the applicability of Article 4, the Government did not contest that this provision applies to various forms of human trafficking. However, they considered that the Court should adopt a clear position on the issue of human trafficking by defining the meaning of that concept and the material scope of Article 4 in that regard. In any event, in their view, there was no human trafficking in the present case as the element of “means” of human trafficking, as conceived in the international definition of that phenomenon, was missing. In particular, the Government considered that the applicant had not been subjected to any threat, or to the use of force, or other forms of coercion.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">232.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this respect, the Government relied on the findings of fact by the domestic courts, which, in the Government’s view, were relevant for determining the applicability of Article 4. Moreover, the Government argued that some other elements of human trafficking were missing. In particular, the Government pointed out that T.M. had not confiscated the applicant’s papers, that he had not deprived her of her liberty, that she had had her mobile phone and the possibility to contact others, that she had not been without any income as she had shared her earnings with T.M., and that she had voluntarily decided to engage in prostitution in order to earn money. The Government also argued that the fact that the applicant had been recognised as a victim of human trafficking by the relevant domestic services could in no way be interpreted as implying that she had been subjected to human trafficking within the meaning of the criminal law.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">233.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government also considered that a situation where an individual benefited from the prostitution of another without any use of force or coercion could not fall within the scope of Article 4 as that would extend the scope of Article 4 beyond the international definition of human trafficking. Such a position would bring uncertainty as regards the scope of Article 4 and would also run counter to the spirit of that provision and the Court’s earlier case-law on the matter (referring to </span><span class="sA36B60A1">V.T. v. France</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above). Moreover, it would mean that all forms of prostitution were prohibited conduct under Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4. Such a position could raise an issue as regards the practice of those States that had not criminalised prostitution and could lower the rights of the victims, who also enjoyed protection under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention. In sum, in the Government’s view, no issue could arise under Article 4 with regard to the fact that T.M. had not been convicted of the offence of procuring prostitution.</span></p><p class="sC79167A"><span class="s29100277">(b)</span><span class="s4E0353E8">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">The applicant</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">234.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant stressed that the allegations she had made before the prosecuting authorities (the police and the State Attorney’s Office) and later before the criminal court undoubtedly showed that she had been a victim of human trafficking and that she had raised an issue under Article 4 of the Convention. In this connection, the applicant also pointed out that she had been recognised as a victim of human trafficking at the domestic level; this finding had not had, and should not have had, only an administrative character but was also of importance in the sphere of criminal law.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">235.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, the applicant also found it relevant that in their submissions before the Chamber the Government had argued that the recognition of her status as a victim of human trafficking at the domestic level, coupled with the measures of assistance and support, amounted to a loss of her victim status under Article 34 of the Convention (see § 41 of the Chamber judgment). Thus, the applicant found unconvincing the Government’s submissions before the Grand Chamber in which they had essentially changed their mind as to the importance of the recognition of her status as a victim of human trafficking.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">236.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the applicant’s view, the procedural response of the prosecuting authorities, including the criminal courts, to her allegations had been inadequate and contrary to the requirements of Articles 3, 4 and 8 of the Convention.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In particular, due to their lack of sensitivity concerning the matter, the domestic authorities had failed properly to recognise her allegations as involving human trafficking and had thus failed properly to discharge their procedural obligation under Article 4 of the Convention.</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sBA1F0987"><span>The Court’s assessment</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">237.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Grand Chamber is not precluded from examining, where appropriate, questions concerning the admissibility of an application under Article 35 § 4 of the Convention, as that provision enables the Court to dismiss applications it considers inadmissible “at any stage of the proceedings”. Therefore, even at the merits stage and subject to Rule 55 of the Rules of Court, the Court may reconsider a decision to declare an application admissible where it concludes that it should have been declared inadmissible for one of the reasons given in the first three paragraphs of Article 35 of the Convention (see, for instance,</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> Muršić v.

The first concerns the applicability of the guarantees under Article 4, which the Court finds more appropriate to address following an assessment of the scope of protection under that provision and on the basis of a careful assessment of the particular circumstances of the case at hand. The Court therefore joins this objection to the merits.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">239.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The second limb of the Government’s objection could be interpreted as an invitation to the Court to declare the applicant’s complaints inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded given that, in the Government’s view, they simply concern dissatisfaction with the outcome of the proceedings (see paragraph 230 above). However, the Court considers that the applicant’s complaints raise complex issues relating to the interpretation of, in particular, Article 4 of the Convention and cannot be considered manifestly ill-founded. Accordingly, the Court finds this second limb of the Government’s objection unfounded. It should therefore be dismissed (compare </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Zubac v.

Indeed, allegations of ill-treatment and abuse are inherently linked to trafficking and exploitation, whenever that is the alleged purpose for which the ill-treatment or abuse was inflicted (see, in general, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 252, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">C.N. and V. v.

This had led to the recognition of her status as a victim of human trafficking by the national authorities. In addition, the national courts had established as uncontested that T.M. had given the applicant a mobile telephone for the purpose of clients’ contacting her for sexual services and that T.M. had driven the applicant to the clients or that she had provided sexual services in the flat she had occupied together with him.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">245.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In these circumstances, the Chamber considered it unnecessary to identify whether the treatment of which the applicant complained constituted slavery, servitude or forced or compulsory labour. Instead, it concluded that trafficking itself as well as exploitation of prostitution, within the meaning of Article 3 (a) of the Palermo Protocol, Article 4 (a) of the Anti-Trafficking Convention, Article 1 of the 1949 Convention and the CEDAW, fell within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">246.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Chamber thus decided to assess the present case under Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4 of the Convention. In this connection, it also noted that it was irrelevant that the applicant was actually a national of the respondent State and that there had been no international element since Article 2 of the Anti</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Trafficking Convention encompassed “all forms of trafficking in human beings, whether national or transnational” and the 1949 Convention referred to exploitation of prostitution in general.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">247.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Relying, in particular, on the general principles developed by the Court in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">(cited above, §§ 272-89), the Chamber considered that the applicant’s complaints had three aspects and assessed them separately. The first aspect was whether there was an appropriate legal and regulatory framework at the domestic level; the second was whether the applicant had been provided with appropriate assistance and support to alleviate the fear and pressure she had felt while testifying against T.M.; and the third was whether in the application of that framework in the applicant’s particular case the national authorities had complied with their procedural obligations.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">248.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the first aspect of the complaint, the Chamber was satisfied that at the time the alleged offence had been committed and prosecuted there had been an adequate legal framework at the domestic level concerning trafficking in human beings, forced prostitution and exploitation of prostitution. With regard to the second aspect of the complaint, the Chamber considered that the applicant had been provided with adequate support and assistance.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">249.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the third aspect of the complaint, the Chamber held that there had been no indication that the national authorities had made a serious attempt to investigate in depth all the circumstances relevant for assessing whether T.M. had forced the applicant into prostitution. Also, the Chamber considered that the domestic courts’ assessment of the applicant’s statement had not taken into account the possible impact of psychological trauma on the applicant’s ability to consistently and clearly relate the circumstances of her exploitation. In these circumstances, the Chamber considered that the relevant State authorities had not fulfilled their procedural obligation and thus found a violation of Article 4 of the Convention.</span></p><ol start="2" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>The parties’ submissions</span><ol type="1" class="s743F3A55"><li class="sB393C677"><span>The applicant</span></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">250.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant contended that the prosecuting authorities had erroneously characterised her allegations, which undoubtedly suggested that she had been a victim of trafficking, as an issue of forced prostitution. Relying on different monitoring reports in respect of Croatia, the applicant argued that there was a general issue in relation to the conduct of the domestic authorities who tended to classify charges of human trafficking as an offence of procuring prostitution, which left many instances of trafficking unpunished.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">251.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant further argued that when submitting her complaint to the domestic authorities, she had provided all relevant details of the case and identified witnesses who could have provided further information concerning her allegations. According to the applicant, when she had submitted her complaint, the prosecuting authorities had advised her that she had done everything she could and that they were taking over the investigation. Ultimately, however, out of five possible witnesses concerning the events, the prosecuting authorities had only questioned one.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">252.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, the applicant also stressed that at the time of the events she had not trusted the system and had decided to report the events to the police due to T.M.’s threats relating to her family. Moreover, at the time when the criminal proceedings took place she had been seriously afraid of T.M., who had threatened her after she had run away from him. In such circumstances, she had decided to tell her story to the relevant court only after she had been provided with legal assistance by the Rosa Centre. However, according to the applicant, that legal assistance had not been part of the State legal aid but an assistance provided by a non-governmental organisation at the request of the applicant’s mother.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">253.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In these circumstances, it could not be said that she had been passive during the proceedings as she had given her statements three times, provided detailed information about the events and identified all possible witnesses. Thus, in her view, as a victim of human trafficking she could not have been expected to do more. In particular, it would be unreasonable to expect that she should take the position of the State Attorney’s Office, which was </span><span class="sA36B60A1">ex officio</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> obliged to conduct the relevant criminal proceedings effectively.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">254.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant also contended that the State Attorney’s Office and the criminal court had failed to ensure, each within their scope of competence and if needed in cooperation with each other, that the relevant measures were taken so that the offence against her did not remain unpunished. In her view, they should have reclassified the charges against T.M. so as to ensure that he was punished at least for the basic form of procuring prostitution. However, the State Attorney’s Office and the criminal court had remained passive, shifting the responsibility from one to another. Moreover, the domestic courts had demonstrated a lack of sensitivity towards the emotional trauma suffered by the victims of human trafficking and its impact on their capacity to relate all details of the case. This ultimately resulted in a situation in which she, as a victim of human trafficking, had been left unprotected by the authorities from T.M.’s actions. It also opened the door to the possibility of her future abuse by T.M. given that he was, as was clear from M.I.’s evidence, obsessed with her (the applicant).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">255.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In sum, relying also on her submissions during the Chamber proceedings, the applicant considered that the domestic criminal-law mechanisms as applied in the case at hand were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the State’s positive obligations under Article 4 of the Convention.</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sBA1F0987"><span>The Government</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">256.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government argued that there was no deficiency in the domestic legal framework concerning the issue of human trafficking or other related conduct. In this connection, the Government stressed that the domestic authorities were making continuous efforts to strengthen the administrative and operational practices aimed at enhancing the fight against trafficking in human beings. Thus, so far a total of 117 judges and prosecutors had finished training on the issues of human trafficking and specialised courses on the matter were also part of the training given to the police. In particular, as regards those involved in the present case, the prosecutor who first questioned T.M. (see paragraph 23 above) had attended two one-day training sessions on human trafficking in February 2005 and November 2009. The trial judge had attended two one-day training sessions on the matter in September 2003 and February 2005, while one of the judges sitting in the appeal court had conducted a one-day training course in November 2013. Moreover, the Government argued that in recent years the number of identified victims of human trafficking was increasing and so was the number of convictions for human trafficking.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">257.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government also submitted, relying on the Chamber’s findings (see paragraph 248 above), that the applicant had been provided with all the relevant services of protection, support and assistance, which was all in compliance with the relevant GRETA recommendations. Moreover, the Government pointed out that the applicant had not made any complaint in this regard before the domestic authorities.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">258.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the authorities’ compliance with their procedural obligation, the Government considered that the domestic authorities had diligently investigated the case on the basis of the applicant’s allegations by collecting all the relevant evidence in this regard. In this connection, the Government pointed out that the applicant had been legally represented throughout the proceedings and that she had never proposed any evidence to be taken by the authorities or made any complaint in that regard.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">259.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Moreover, in the Government’s view, the domestic courts had adopted their decision on the basis of the established facts and their findings could not be considered arbitrary. In particular, even assuming that non</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">coerced exploitation of prostitution fell under Article 4, the domestic courts could not be criticised for not reclassifying the State Attorney’s indictment from forced exploitation of prostitution to that form as that would entail an unjustified interference with the nature and cause of the accusations against the accused.</span></p><ol start="3" type="1" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sBA1F0987"><span>The third-party interveners</span></li></ol><p class="s71EEDCF9"><span class="s29100277">(a)</span><span class="s30C8A987">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">The Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (“GRETA”)</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">260.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">GRETA stressed that one of the core objectives of the Anti</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Trafficking Convention was to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of trafficking offences. However, GRETA’s country monitoring revealed that there was a significant disparity between the number of identified victims of trafficking, on the one hand, and the number of prosecutions and convictions, on the other hand. The identified reasons for this were numerous and included, in particular, overreliance on victims’ statements, issues related to the credibility of witnesses who might change their statements over time, or difficulties in relation to the sufficiency of evidence.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, GRETA pointed out that victims were sometimes afraid or reluctant to make depositions because of threats of revenge from the perpetrators or lack of trust in the effectiveness of the criminal justice system.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">261.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">At the same time, in some trafficking cases, as research from the field showed, the only evidence available to the court was the victim’s testimony and the defendant’s denial. In such cases, the courts were called upon to decide whether the victim’s testimony sufficed to convict a defendant, even when his or her allegations were denied by the defendant and it was a word-against-word situation. GRETA stressed that a failure of the prosecution to support the victim’s statement with other evidence, such as testimonial evidence of customers served by victims, neighbours who might be able to provide facts about the victim’s situation, NGO members who could testify about the psychological state of victims, expert opinions or financial investigations, might lead to the exoneration of the defendant.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">262.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">One of the important reasons for such an outcome was a lack of training and specialisation of investigators, prosecutors, judges and lawyers on the matters of human trafficking, which could lead them to be prejudiced </span><span class="sA36B60A1">vis-à-vis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> victims of trafficking and insensitive to the problems experienced by them. Thus, GRETA had repeatedly stressed the need to improve the training and specialisation of those involved in cases concerning human trafficking.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">263.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The same was true for Croatia. In the country monitoring of Croatia, GRETA noted that prosecutions for the offence of trafficking in human beings had been rare, that victims had not been properly informed of and assisted in the use of their rights, and that victims had been reluctant to cooperate with the criminal justice authorities. Moreover, GRETA’s findings suggested that judges were reportedly not sufficiently aware of the particular vulnerability of victims of human trafficking. GRETA had also been provided with examples of cases where other offences, in particular procuring prostitution, had been prosecuted instead of human trafficking, and perpetrators had been given lighter sentences in such cases, as well as instances where victims of sexual exploitation acting as witnesses had not been treated with the required sensitivity. GRETA had thus, in particular, repeatedly insisted on increased training for judges and public prosecutors on the legislation concerning trafficking in human beings.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">264.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">GRETA also stressed that one of the measures to fight trafficking in human beings included the necessity to ensure protection of victims and witnesses of human trafficking, as provided for in the Anti-Trafficking Convention. GRETA had thus made recommendations to the Croatian authorities concerning this matter as well.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">265.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Lastly, GRETA elaborated, in particular, on the issue of “abuse of vulnerability” as one of the “means” of human trafficking. GRETA stressed that establishing the existence of victim vulnerability was important for many aspects of a trafficking case, as vulnerability could be a critical indicator when identifying victims, and accurate assessment of vulnerability could help to ensure that victim witnesses were appropriately supported and protected. In criminal prosecutions, both the existence of vulnerability and the abuse of that vulnerability should be established by credible evidence. In this context, GRETA also referred to a UNODC study according to which the mere existence of vulnerability might suffice to satisfy the means element and thereby help support a conviction. Thus, GRETA had insisted in the country evaluation procedures that the “abuse of vulnerability” be properly addressed. In sum, GRETA stressed that evidence of an abuse of a position of vulnerability might be less tangible than for other means used to commit a human-trafficking offence, such as the use of force. It was therefore important to involve specialists, such as psychologists, social workers or NGO representatives working with victims of trafficking, at the investigative phase to ensure that evidence was effectively and appropriately collected and presented at the trial.</span></p><p class="sC79167A"><span class="s4DDA3AA3">(b)</span><span class="s4E0353E8">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s4DDA3AA3">Clinique doctorale de droit international des droits de l’homme (Faculté de droit d’Aix-en-Provence)</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">266.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The third-party intervener pointed out that forced prostitution could be considered as a form of forced labour and that force or coercion in this context could be of different kinds, such as psychological, physical or financial. In such instances, when there was force or coercion, any consent of the victim was excluded. In the intervener’s view, when related to human trafficking and to the practices associated with slavery, prostitution should be characterised as slavery (sexual slavery) within the meaning of Article 4 of the Convention. This conclusion followed from the Court’s case-law which made reference to the issue of modern day slavery and it also followed from other international jurisdictions such as the Inter-American Court, the Special Tribunal for Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Court. Indeed, in the intervener’s view, such an approach was consistent with the international definition and approach to slavery.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">267.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, the third-party intervener argued that when prostitution was exploited by others for economic gain it amounted to trafficking. However, “exploitation” in this context had to be associated with a </span><span class="sA36B60A1">de facto</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> exertion of coercion. Thus, even if a person voluntarily engaged in prostitution, his or her abuse by a third party would be indicative of some form of coercion into prostitution.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">268.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The third-party intervener also argued that persons engaged in prostitution belonged to a vulnerable group and that this applied in particular to women, as was recognised in various international instruments. Such vulnerability was in some cases further exacerbated by economic constraints or the race of the victim. Thus, an intersectional approach was needed to address the issue of vulnerability. For instance, at the national level in France, it was recognised that abuse of vulnerability referred to a totality of situations of distress that could lead a person to accept his or her exploitation. In the intervener’s view, this vulnerability needed to be taken into account in the context of the duty to investigate and in the context of the taking and assessment of the victim’s evidence. In particular, in connection with the latter aspect, the third-party intervener stressed that it was a well-known fact that the victim’s evidence could be incoherent and contradictory as a result of the treatment to which the victim had been subjected and that this was insufficient to conclude that the victim had provided false evidence. Thus, emphasis should be placed on the essential aspects of the victim’s evidence and it was important to obtain further evidence concerning the impugned situation.</span></p><p class="sC79167A"><span class="s29100277">(c)</span><span class="s30C8A987">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">Research Centre </span><span class="s4DDA3AA3">L’altro diritto onlus</span><span class="s29100277"> (University of Florence)</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">269.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The third-party intervener argued that it was a common understanding in international law that the Palermo Protocol, when read in conjunction with its parent Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, required criminalisation not only of trans-border but also of internal trafficking. Indeed, the most recent UNODC </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Global reports on trafficking in persons</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> pointed out that victims who had been detected within their own borders represented the largest part of the victims detected worldwide. Moreover, the Anti-Trafficking Convention explicitly included within the definition of human trafficking instances of internal trafficking. The European Union Anti-Trafficking Directive also covered internal and cross-border trafficking.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">270.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, the third-party intervener stressed that, as it followed from the UNODC material, “movement” was not a necessary requirement of the definition of human trafficking. That definition also included instances, such as receipt and harbouring, which did not involve movement. Thus, the third-party intervener considered that it was important that the Court recognise both internal and cross-border trafficking as the constituent elements of the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">271.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The third-party intervener further submitted that the issue of “exploitation of prostitution” could not be taken out of the context of human trafficking as done by the Chamber in the present case. In this connection, the intervener stressed that the issues of prostitution and exploitation of prostitution raised some very sensitive questions on which opinions differed, in particular between those who saw prostitution as being a degrading and exploitive practice in itself and others who saw it as a form of work. In this context, the domestic practices also differed and in the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">V.T. v.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">France</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> case (cited above) the Court had not wished to take a stance on this particular matter. In these circumstances, in the intervener’s view, when relying on the 1949 Convention, which had a very ambivalent approach towards prostitution and exploitation of prostitution, the Chamber judgment had essentially raised an issue of the Court’s neutrality in this debate.</span></p><p class="sC79167A"><span class="s29100277">(d)</span><span class="s4E0353E8">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">Group of researchers Bénédicte Bourgeois (University of Michigan), Marie-Xavière Catto (University Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne) and Michel Erpelding (Max Planck Institute Luxembourg for Procedural Law)</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">272.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The third-party interveners firstly stressed that, due to different historical and legal reasons, under general international law the notions of slavery, forced labour and servitude were imperfectly compartmentalised concepts. However, under international human rights law these phenomena were addressed within single provisions and their general and unconditional prohibition was clearly proclaimed. As regards the Court’s approach to these phenomena, the third-party interveners considered its case-law as representing a “gradation model” where slavery was not considered to be a distinct phenomenon from forced labour but the most severe form of it, while servitude constituted an intermediate form of abuse. For the interveners, the Court had a wide judicial discretion in interpreting the definitions used in early instruments concerning slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour when taken in the context of individual human rights protection.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">273.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The third-party interveners further submitted that the three legal concepts mentioned in Article 4 of the Convention (slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour) pertained to different forms of human exploitation, as followed from the Court’s case-law in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin v. France</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;73316/01&quot;]}" target="_blank">73316/01</a>, ECHR 2005</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">VII). However, they noted that in the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> case (cited above), the Court had brought an additional concept within the ambit of Article 4: that of human trafficking. For the interveners, there was no doubt that the concept of human trafficking was inherently linked to that of human exploitation. Indeed, the blameworthiness of human trafficking stemmed from its purpose, namely severe exploitation of human beings. Thus, there was no doubt that such conduct fell within the scope of Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4 of the Convention. However, the third-party interveners asserted that the Court’s reasoning in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> was incoherent as it confused the concepts of human trafficking and slavery. Moreover, noting the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> approach, the third-party interveners argued that there were many uncertainties in the scope of these concepts relating, in particular, to the threshold of severity attached to particular conduct.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">274.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The third-party interveners also pointed out that the international definition of human trafficking did not define the element of sexual exploitation. In particular, during the preparatory work on the Palermo Protocol several national delegations had wanted to distinguish victims of prostitution from those who had chosen to engage in prostitution. It was finally decided to leave the concept undefined. Eventually, however, UNODC had attempted to define the concept of “exploitation of prostitution of others” but linked it to an issue of unlawfulness in domestic law (see</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">paragraph 117 above). For the third-party interveners, this created a problem of circular reasoning and the risk that States through their national laws might preclude characterising a particular situation as exploitation. In the intervener’s view, from the perspective of international human rights law this was unacceptable and thus the Court needed to have recourse to its autonomous concept doctrine in order to define “exploitation”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">275.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Lastly, the third-party interveners stressed that the concept of forced prostitution was a similar, but in practice distinct, matter from rape or sexual slavery. The concept of forced prostitution implied a financial gain for its perpetrator. In the third-party interveners’ view, the Court might consider drawing inferences from the definition of forced prostitution in international criminal law in order to define this concept in international human rights law.</span></p><ol start="3" type="A" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sDAD2B73A"><span>The Court’s assessment</span><ol type="1" class="s743F3A55"><li class="sB393C677"><span>Introductory remarks</span></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">276.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court has not so far had many opportunities to consider the extent to which treatment associated with human trafficking and/or exploitation of prostitution falls within the scope of the Convention. At the same time, trafficking in human beings and exploitation of prostitution as global phenomena are receiving significantly more attention in recent years. As the overview of international material shows, different international legal instruments and supervision mechanisms have dealt with these issues and elaborated on the central tenets of their effective prevention and suppression.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">277.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Regard being had to the parties’ submissions and the third-party interveners’ comments, the present case allows the Court to clarify certain aspects of its case-law on human trafficking for the purpose of exploitation of prostitution. It also requires the Court to address the statement in paragraph 54 of the Chamber judgment according to which “trafficking itself </span><span class="sA36B60A1">as well as</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> exploitation of prostitution ... fall within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention” (emphasis added).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">278.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court will now address the question of the material scope of Article 4 of the Convention. In this connection, it will first give an overview of the relevant standards relating to the three concepts enunciated under Article 4 (slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour). Secondly, it will address the issue of trafficking in human beings under Article 4 of the Convention. Thirdly, it will turn to the question of “exploitation of prostitution” under that provision. The Court will then address the States’ positive obligations under Article 4 of the Convention.</span></p><ol start="2" type="1" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sBA1F0987"><span>Scope of Article 4 of the Convention</span></li></ol><p class="s71EEDCF9"><span class="s29100277">(a)</span><span class="s30C8A987">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">The three concepts enunciated under Article 4 of the Convention</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">279.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Article 4 refers to three concepts: slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour. However, as the Court has already observed in its case-law, the Convention does not define any of them (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Van der Mussele v.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Belgium</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 23 November 1983, § 32, Series A no. 70, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 121-25). Thus, in determining the material scope of Article 4 of the Convention, the Court has sought guidance in various instruments of international law dealing with these concepts.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">280.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In its early case-law, as regards the concept of “slavery”, the Court referred to the 1927 Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade and Slavery, which defined slavery as “the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised”. As to the concept of “servitude”, the Court had regard to the European Commission of Human Rights’ earlier case-law and the 1956 Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade and Slavery, according to which that concept related to a “particularly serious form of denial of freedom” and included “in addition to the obligation to perform certain services for others ... the obligation for the ‘serf’ to live on another person’s property and the impossibility of altering his condition”. In sum, having regard to these elements, the Court held that the concept of “servitude” had to be understood as “an obligation to provide one’s services that is imposed by the use of coercion” (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 122-25). It also observed that servitude corresponded to “aggravated” forced or compulsory labour (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">C.N. and V. v. France</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 89-91).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">281.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As regards the definition of “forced or compulsory labour”, in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Van der Mussele</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (cited above, § 32) the Court noted that no clear guidance on this point was to be found in the various Council of Europe documents relating to the preparatory work of the Convention. However, the Court considered it evident that the text of Article 4 was to a large extent based on the ILO’s 1930 Forced Labour Convention (No. 29). Thus, in view of the fact that this legal instrument was binding on nearly all the member States of the Council of Europe, the Court considered that the ILO’s definition of “forced or compulsory labour” should be taken as a starting-point for the interpretation of Article 4 of the Convention (see also </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 115-16, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Stummer v.

According to this definition, “forced or compulsory labour” means all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered him or herself voluntarily (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">140-43</span><span class="s29100277"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">282.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">On the basis of the ILO definition, as regards the concept of “labour” under Article 4 § 2 of the Convention, the Court stressed that it should be understood in a broader sense as “all work or service”. As to the “forced or compulsory” nature of such labour, the Court noted that the adjective “forced” brought to mind the idea of physical or mental constraint and the second adjective (“compulsory”) referred to a situation where work was “exacted ... under the menace of any penalty” and also performed against the will of the person concerned, that is work for which he “has not offered himself voluntarily”. The Court also clarified that the concept of “penalty” had to be understood in a broader sense as “any” or “a” penalty. Moreover, the Court stressed that in the event of the existence of a risk comparable to “the menace of [a] penalty”, relative weight was to be attached to the argument regarding “prior consent” to an activity (see</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> Van der Mussele</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, §§ 34-37; </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, §§ 115-17; </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Stummer</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, § 117; and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Chowdury and Others</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, §§</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">90-91, all cited above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">283.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In its subsequent case-law, the Court further clarified some of the elements of the definition of “forced or compulsory labour” set out in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Van der Mussele</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">. In particular, in the above-cited </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">case (§§ 114-20), in which it was called upon to elaborate on the extent to which treatment essentially associated with trafficking fell within the scope of Article 4, the Court referred to the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Van der Mussele</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> concept of “forced or compulsory labour” and further held that the concept of “a penalty” extended to any equivalent situation in terms of the perceived seriousness of the threat. With regard to the question of “consent” to the work in issue, the Court referred to the absence of a choice.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">284.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Moreover, in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">C.N. and V. v. France</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (cited above, § 77), relying on an ILO report, the Court elaborated on the concept of “a penalty” explaining that this concept “may go as far as physical violence or restraint, but it can also take subtler forms, of a psychological nature, such as threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">285.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the recent case of </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Chowdury and Others </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">(cited above, § 96), the Court elaborated on the concept of “consent” stressing that “where an employer abuses his power or takes advantage of the vulnerability of his workers in order to exploit them, they do not offer themselves for work voluntarily”. Thus, the Court further stressed that “[t]he prior consent of the victim is not sufficient to exclude the characterisation of work as forced labour” and that “[t]he question whether an individual offers himself for work voluntarily is a factual question which must be examined in the light of all the relevant circumstances of a case”.</span></p><p class="sC79167A"><span class="s29100277">(b)</span><span class="s4E0353E8">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">Trafficking in human beings under Article 4 of the Convention</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">286.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The most important development in the Court’s case-law on the issue of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation occurred with the adoption of its judgment in the case of </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">(cited above). The case concerned the alleged trafficking and death of a young Russian woman, who had been recruited to work as a “cabaret artiste” in Cyprus (which different organisations had denounced as a cover-up for prostitution) and who then died in suspicious circumstances following a conflict with the man for whom she had worked.

It has long stated that one of the main principles of the application of the Convention provisions is that it does not apply them in a vacuum (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Loizidou v.

The Court must have regard to the fact that the context of the provision is a treaty for the effective protection of individual human rights and that the Convention must be read as a whole, and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (dec.)

However, the Court stressed that in assessing the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, sight should not be lost of the Convention’s special features or of the fact that it was a living instrument which should be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions. Moreover, the increasingly high standards required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably required greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (ibid., § 277).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">289.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court further stressed that “[i]n light of the proliferation of both trafficking itself and of measures taken to combat it, the Court considers it appropriate in the present case to examine the extent to which trafficking itself may be considered to run counter to the spirit and purpose of Article 4 of the Convention such as to fall within the scope of the guarantees offered by that Article without the need to assess which of the three types of proscribed conduct are engaged by the particular treatment in the case in question” (ibid., § 279). Finally, the Court concluded the following:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“282.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">There can be no doubt that trafficking threatens the human dignity and fundamental freedoms of its victims and cannot be considered compatible with a democratic society and the values expounded in the Convention. In view of its obligation to interpret the Convention in light of present-day conditions, the Court considers it unnecessary to identify whether the treatment about which the applicant complains constitutes ‘slavery’, ‘servitude’ or ‘forced [or] compulsory labour’. Instead, the Court concludes that trafficking itself, within the meaning of Article 3 (a) of the Palermo Protocol and Article 4 (a) of the Anti-Trafficking Convention, falls within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention. ...”</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">290.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, it follows from </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> that impugned conduct may give rise to an issue of human trafficking under Article 4 of the Convention only if all the constituent elements (action, means, purpose) of the international definition of human trafficking are present (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">113-14 and 155-56 above).

Similarly, in</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> Chowdury and Others</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (cited above, § 93), the Court stressed that “exploitation through work is one of the forms of exploitation covered by the definition of human trafficking, and this highlights the intrinsic relationship between forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">292.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Having regard to these observations, the concept of human trafficking can properly be incorporated, in the Court’s view, within the scope of Article 4.

Moreover, such an approach to the phenomenon of human trafficking is convincingly set out in the ILO materials (see paragraphs 144-45 above), which have traditionally played a key role in informing the scope of guarantees under Article 4 of the Convention (see paragraph 281 above). It should also be noted that it follows from the comparative law material available to the Court that there is universal recognition of human trafficking as a serious crime that involves, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">inter alia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, sexual exploitation. Indeed, all thirty-nine Council of Europe member States for which the comparative information is available criminalise human trafficking (see</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">paragraph 210 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">294.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, it should be noted that there is an apparent difference between the Palermo Protocol and the Anti-Trafficking Convention as regards the scope of their application, the latter being applicable to all forms of trafficking in human beings, whether national or transnational, whether or not connected with organised crime, whereas the former relates to transnational trafficking involving an organised criminal group (see</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">paragraphs 119 and 162 above). It is therefore necessary for the Court to clarify its position on this particular point.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">295.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the Court’s view, there are several reasons why the approach under the Anti-Trafficking Convention should be followed. Firstly, this is dictated by the fact that excluding a group of victims of conduct characterised as human trafficking under the Anti-Trafficking Convention from the scope of protection under the Convention would run counter to the object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings, which requires that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see, for instance, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Güzelyurtlu and Others v. Cyprus and Turkey </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">[GC], no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;36925/07&quot;]}" target="_blank">36925/07</a>, § 234, 29 January 2019). In this connection it should be noted, as follows from the international material and as pointed out by one of the third-party interveners (see paragraph 269 above), that internal trafficking is currently the most common form of trafficking. Secondly, the Court has already held that the member States’ positive obligations under Article 4 of the Convention must be construed in the light of the Council of Europe’s Anti</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Trafficking Convention (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Chowdury and Others</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">104). Thirdly, the limited definitional scope of the Palermo Protocol is relative as, when read in conjunction with its parent instrument (UNCTOC), the Protocol in fact proscribes trafficking irrespective of a transnational element or the involvement of an organised criminal group (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">111 and 120 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">296.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Thus, the Court finds that from the perspective of Article 4 of the Convention the concept of human trafficking covers trafficking in human beings, whether national or transnational, whether or not connected with organised crime, in so far as the constituent elements of the international definition of trafficking in human beings, under the Anti-Trafficking Convention and the Palermo Protocol, are present.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">297.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Such conduct or such a situation of human trafficking then falls within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention. This, however, does not exclude the possibility that, in the particular circumstances of a case, a particular form of conduct related to human trafficking may also raise an issue under another provision of the Convention (see, for instance, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">M. and Others v. Italy and Bulgaria</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §§ 106-07; see also paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">241 above).</span></p><p class="sC79167A"><span class="s29100277">(c)</span><span class="s30C8A987">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">“Exploitation of prostitution” under Article 4 of the Convention</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">298.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It is important to note at the outset that, as also stressed by the third-party intervener L’altro diritto onlus (see paragraph 271 above), the current discussion on the “exploitation of prostitution” opens up some very sensitive issues relating to the approach to prostitution in general. In particular, there are different, often conflicting, views as to whether prostitution as such can ever be consensual or is always a coercive form of exploitation. In this context, it should be noted that prostitution is approached differently in different legal systems depending on the relevant society’s understanding of it (see paragraph 180 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">299.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In </span><span class="sA36B60A1">V.T.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> </span><span class="sA36B60A1">v. France</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (cited above, §§ 24-27 and 35), as the only case so far addressing this particular issue, the Court noted the substantial differences in legal systems concerning the approach to prostitution. In the circumstances of that case, the Court did not consider it relevant to enter into the debate whether prostitution in itself was contrary to, in particular, Article 3 of the Convention. However, it stressed that prostitution was incompatible with the dignity of a person if it was coerced. It held that it was where a person was coerced to engage in, or continue with, prostitution that an issue arose under Article 3. Similarly, as regards Article 4 of the Convention, the Court found that in the absence of coercion of the applicant to continue with prostitution, she could not be considered to have been compelled to perform “forced or compulsory labour” within the meaning of that provision.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">300.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Relying on the above analysis of its case-law under Article 4 of the Convention (see paragraphs 281-85 above), the Court finds that the notion of “forced or compulsory labour” under Article 4 of the Convention aims to protect against instances of serious exploitation, such as forced prostitution, irrespective of whether, in the particular circumstances of a case, they are related to the specific human-trafficking context. Moreover, any such conduct may have elements qualifying it as “servitude” or “slavery” under Article 4, or may raise an issue under another provision of the Convention (see paragraphs 241 and 280 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">301.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this context, it is important to stress that</span><span class="s29100277"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">“force”</span><span class="s29100277"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">may encompass the subtle forms of coercive conduct identified in the Court’s case-law on Article 4 (see paragraphs 281-85 above), as well as by the ILO and in other international materials (see, in particular, paragraphs 141-44 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">302.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court would also point out that the question whether a particular situation involves all the constituent elements of “human trafficking” (action, means, purpose)</span><span class="s29100277"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">and/or</span><span class="s29100277"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">gives rise to a separate issue of forced prostitution is a factual question which must be examined in the light of all the relevant circumstances of a case.</span></p><p class="sC79167A"><span class="s29100277">(d)</span><span class="s4E0353E8">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">Conclusion on the material scope of Article 4</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">303.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In conclusion, having regard to the above considerations, the Court finds the following:</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">(i)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Human trafficking falls within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention.

Indeed, the applicants in these cases are normally victims of trafficking or trafficking-related conduct by another private party, whose actions cannot attract the direct responsibility of the State (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">J. and Others v.

The general principles summarised in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> represent the central tenets of the existing case-law and to date represent the relevant Convention framework within which cases of, or related to, human trafficking are examined.

Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention, Article 4 [§ 1] makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 § 2 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">284.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In assessing whether there has been a violation of Article 4, the relevant legal or regulatory framework in place must be taken into account (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Nachova and Others v.

The Court considers that the spectrum of safeguards set out in national legislation must be adequate to ensure the practical and effective protection of the rights of victims or potential victims of trafficking. Accordingly, in addition to criminal-law measures to punish traffickers, Article 4 requires member States to put in place adequate measures regulating businesses often used as a cover for human trafficking. Furthermore, a State’s immigration rules must address relevant concerns relating to encouragement, facilitation or tolerance of trafficking (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Guerra and Others v.

In order to comply with this obligation, member States are required to put in place a legislative and administrative framework to prohibit and punish trafficking. The Court observes that the Palermo Protocol and the Anti-Trafficking Convention refer to the need for a comprehensive approach to combat trafficking which includes measures to prevent trafficking and to protect victims, in addition to measures to punish traffickers ... It is clear from the provisions of these two instruments that the Contracting States, including almost all of the member States of the Council of Europe, have formed the view that only a combination of measures addressing all three aspects can be effective in the fight against trafficking ... Accordingly, the duty to penalise and prosecute trafficking is only one aspect of member States’ general undertaking to combat trafficking.

It is relevant to the consideration of the proportionality of any positive obligation arising in the present case that the Palermo Protocol, signed by both Cyprus and the Russian Federation in 2000, requires States to endeavour to provide for the physical safety of victims of trafficking while in their territories and to establish comprehensive policies and programmes to prevent and combat trafficking ...

There is no absolute right to obtain the prosecution or conviction of any particular person where there were no culpable failures in seeking to hold perpetrators of criminal offences accountable (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">A, B and C v.

Thus, the fact that an investigation ends without concrete, or with only limited, results is not indicative of any failings as such (see, for instance, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Brecknell v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;32457/04&quot;]}" target="_blank">32457/04</a>, § 66, 27 November 2007). Moreover, the procedural obligation must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> J. and Others</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> </span><span class="sA36B60A1">v.

In particular, the investigation’s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. Failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines to a decisive extent the investigation’s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and the identity of those responsible (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Hentschel and Stark v.

Such special treatment of a potential victim of human trafficking does not necessarily presuppose an official confirmation that the offence has been established, and may be independent of the authorities’ duty to investigate. Indeed, (potential) victims need support even before the offence of human trafficking is formally established; otherwise, this would run counter to the whole purpose of victim protection in trafficking cases.

In this connection, the Court would also stress the necessity of the protection of the rights of the suspects or accused, in particular the right to the presumption of innocence and other fair-trial guarantees under Article 6 of the Convention (see, for instance, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Schatschaschwili v.

This corresponds in essence to the Court’s approach in other cases concerning, in particular, Article 3 of the Convention (see, for instance,</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> Hassan v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> [GC], no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"><a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;29750/09&quot;]}" target="_blank">29750/09</a>, § 62, ECHR 2014; </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Bouyid</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">124; and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Beganović v.

This is particularly true when there are allegations that such conclusions and the relevant domestic proceedings were marred by significant procedural flaws. Indeed, relying on such domestic findings and conclusions would entail a risk of creating a circular reasoning resulting in a case concerning an arguable claim or prima facie evidence of treatment contrary to Article 4 remaining outside the Court’s scrutiny under the Convention.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">326.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the present case, the applicant complained before the domestic authorities that she had been forced into prostitution by T.M. She explained how initially he had contacted her via Facebook and that on that occasion T.M. had presented himself as a friend of her parents and promised to help her finding a job. She also explained that she had had no reason to question T.M.’s intentions and continued exchanging messages with him, which eventually led to a first situation where he had insisted on her providing sexual services to others. On that occasion, according to the applicant’s allegations, T.M. had assured her that she would be doing that only until he found her a proper job. However, according to the applicant, T.M. had afterwards started exerting pressure on her by the use of force, threats and close monitoring. He had also made the necessary arrangements for the provision of her sexual services by securing accommodation, transportation and other facilities, such as by providing her with a mobile phone and advertising her services. The applicant also stated that T.M. had taken half the money she had charged for the provision of sexual services (see paragraphs 12-17 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">327.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The preliminary police investigation concerning the applicant’s allegations led to a search of T.M.’s premises and his car, during which the police found condoms, two automatic rifles with ammunition, a hand grenade and a number of mobile phones (see paragraph 19 above). In addition, it was established during the preliminary investigation that T.M. had been trained as a policeman and that he had been convicted of procuring prostitution using force, and of rape (see paragraphs 20-21 above). During T.M.’s first questioning, he denied forcing the applicant into prostitution but admitted that he had on one occasion used force against her and also stated that he had lent her money for the flat she had rented (see paragraph 23 above). On the basis of the applicant’s complaint and the results of the preliminary investigation, a further investigation was conducted by the State Attorney’s Office (see paragraphs 24-37 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">328.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the Court’s view, the above circumstances clearly indicate that the applicant made an arguable claim and that furthermore there was prima facie evidence that she had been the victim of treatment contrary to Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4 of the Convention, as defined by the Court (see paragraph 303 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">329.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Thus, for instance, the applicant’s personal situation undoubtedly suggested that she belonged to a vulnerable group (see paragraphs 10 and 158 above), while T.M.’s position and background suggested that he was capable of assuming a dominant position over her and abusing her vulnerability for the purpose of exploitation of prostitution (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">20-21 above). Further, the means used by T.M. when he had allegedly first contacted the applicant and recruited her is also indicative of one of the means often used by traffickers to recruit their victims. This was also true of the alleged promise of employment, accompanied by the applicant’s belief that she had no reason for concern (see paragraphs 157-58 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">330.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Moreover, the applicant’s allegations that T.M. made the necessary arrangements for her to provide sexual services by securing accommodation and other facilities suggested the elements of harbouring as one of the constituent “actions” of trafficking (see paragraphs 113-14 above). It should further be noted that T.M. admitted using force against the applicant, which required a careful and subtle assessment in the context of the “means” element of human trafficking for the purpose of exploitation of prostitution. The same is true for T.M.’s statement that he lent money to the applicant, which raised an issue of possible debt bondage as another “means” of trafficking.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">331.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It should also be noted that the above allegations and circumstances, which suggested, in particular, that T.M. unlawfully earned money from the provision of sexual services by the applicant in an environment where arguably he assumed a dominant position over her and had recourse to force, threats and other forms of coercion, in any event gave rise to an arguable claim and the existence of prima facie evidence of forced prostitution, which is, in itself, a prohibited form of conduct under Article 4 of the Convention (see</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">paragraph 300 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">332.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In sum, the Court finds that the applicant made an arguable claim and that there was prima facie evidence that she had been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 4 of the Convention – human trafficking and/or forced prostitution – which in turn triggered the domestic authorities’ procedural obligation under that provision (compare </span><span class="sA36B60A1">C.N. v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 72). The Court therefore dismisses the Government’s preliminary objection concerning the applicability of Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">4 of the Convention which it joined to the merits (see paragraph 238 above).</span></p><p class="sC79167A"><span class="s29100277">(b)</span><span class="s4E0353E8">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s29100277">Compliance with the procedural obligation under Article 4 of the Convention</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">333.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court reiterates that the applicant’s complaint is of a procedural nature (see paragraph 229 above). Thus, having regard to the scope of the respondent State’s positive obligations (see paragraph 306 above), in this case the Court will deal with the applicant’s complaint of a deficient response by the domestic authorities to her allegations of human trafficking and/or forced prostitution.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">334.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In making this assessment the Court will examine whether there were significant flaws or shortcomings in the relevant domestic proceedings and decision-making processes (see paragraph 320 above). In particular, the Court will assess whether the applicant’s allegations under Article 4 were properly investigated and subjected to careful scrutiny in accordance with the applicable standards of its case-law (see paragraphs 317-20 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">335.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, it should be noted that the applicant did not clearly articulate her complaints as regards the relevant procedural deficiencies and omissions, a circumstance which gave rise to the question regarding the scope of the case before the Court. Thus, having regard to its findings concerning the scope of the case (see paragraphs 227-29 above), although the Court can take into account the particular procedural omissions it considers relevant in the context of its overall assessment of the applicant’s complaint, in the present case it must exercise caution when assessing the domestic authorities’ compliance with their procedural obligation under Article 4 of the Convention. In any event, in accordance with the general principles set out above, the Court will focus only on significant shortcomings in the domestic authorities’ procedural response to the applicant’s allegations of human trafficking and/or forced prostitution, namely those that were capable of undermining the investigation’s capability of establishing the relevant circumstances of the case (see paragraph 320 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">336.</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the present case, although the prosecuting authorities – namely, the police and the relevant State Attorney’s Office – reacted promptly to the applicant’s allegations against T.M., in their investigation they failed to follow some obvious lines of inquiry capable of elucidating the circumstances of the case and establishing the true nature of the relationship between the applicant and T.M. As already stressed, such a requirement follows from the domestic authorities’ procedural obligation and does not depend on an initiative of the applicant to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see paragraph 314 above; see also </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Mihhailov v. Estonia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;64418/10&quot;]}" target="_blank">64418/10</a>, § 126, 30 August 2016). Indeed, as the prosecuting authorities are better placed than a victim to conduct the investigation, any action or lack of action on the part of the victim cannot justify a lack of action on the part of the prosecuting authorities (see, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">mutatis mutandis</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Asllani v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;24058/13&quot;]}" target="_blank">24058/13</a>, § 62 </span><span class="sA36B60A1">in fine</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, 10 December 2015).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">337.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, for instance, it should be noted that there is no indication that the prosecuting authorities made any effort to inquire into the circumstances of the applicant’s and T.M.’s contact via Facebook, although, as noted above, such contacts represent one of the recognised ways used by traffickers to recruit their victims. Indeed, the prosecuting authorities never sought to inspect the applicant’s or T.M.’s Facebook accounts and thus to ascertain the nature of their first contact and further exchanges. Moreover, the available evidence suggested that T.M. used Facebook to threaten the applicant after she had left him (see paragraphs 37 and 67 above), but there is no indication that the authorities followed this lead to determine the real nature of their relationship and whether those threats suggested the use of a means of coercion by T.M.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">338.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Further, neither during the investigation nor after the relevant information surfaced during the trial did the prosecuting authorities give any consideration to obtaining evidence from the applicant’s parents, in particular the applicant’s mother. Nevertheless, the applicant’s mother appears to have had earlier contact and difficulties with T.M., which he, according to the available evidence, used as one of the means of pressure and threats towards the applicant (see paragraphs 62, 67 and 73 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">339.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The prosecuting authorities also never sought to identify and interview the owner of the flat where the applicant lived with T.M. in order to determine the circumstances in which the flat had been rented and thus to clarify who in reality was in charge of the whole rental process, which could have been relevant for establishing the potential action of “harbouring”, as an element of human trafficking. Moreover, although later in the course of the criminal proceedings the applicant stated that the owner of the flat used to come and visit the flat (see paragraph 63 above), the State Attorney’s Office did not seek to have the owner questioned in order to establish her impression of the atmosphere in the flat and the relationship between the applicant and T.M. during the critical period.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">340.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It is also worth noting that the prosecuting authorities did not identify and interview any of the neighbours. They too would potentially have been able to provide information on the circumstances of the applicant’s and T.M.’s stay in the flat, relating, in particular, to the question whether and how often the applicant was seen leaving the flat, whether she went outside alone without T.M., and whether and how often T.M. left the flat. All these elements could have clarified the applicant’s allegations as regards the circumstances in which she was under T.M.’s control during their stay in the flat, it being understood that the mere fact that the applicant left the flat on occasion could not conclusively mean that she was not being coerced by T.M. (compare </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Siliadin</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above, § 127).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">341.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Against the background of the above shortcomings, it should be noted that, in addition to the search of T.M.’s flat and car and the questioning of the applicant and T.M., the only action taken by the prosecuting authorities was the questioning of the applicant’s friend, M.I. (see paragraphs 32-37 above). However, the evidence she gave during the investigation and the criminal proceedings contradicted in places some of the information provided by the applicant. Moreover, M.I.’s statement suggested that the key persons having information on the applicant’s alleged escape from T.M. were her (M.I.’s) mother and boyfriend (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">33 and 66 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">342.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, the prosecuting authorities never sought to question M.I.’s mother and boyfriend, who could have provided details on the applicant’s alleged escape from T.M. and whose evidence could have served to ascertain the consistency of M.I.’s statement and reliability of her oral evidence. The same is true of the applicant’s and M.I.’s contradicting statements as regards the circumstances in which the applicant collected her belongings from the flat where she had lived with T.M., which could have been clarified by questioning the owner of the flat. However, as already noted, the prosecuting authorities never sought to question the owner of the flat.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">343.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">All these elements, in the Court’s view, suggest that the prosecuting authorities did not effectively investigate all relevant circumstances of the case or follow some of the obvious lines of inquiry in order to gather the available evidence, in accordance with their procedural obligation under Article 4. Instead, they relied heavily on the applicant’s statement and thus, in essence, created a situation in the subsequent court proceedings where her allegations simply had to be pitted against the denial of T.M., without much further evidence being presented.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">344.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In this connection, the Court notes the position of GRETA and other international bodies on the requirements of effective investigation and prosecution of human-trafficking offences. In particular, having regard to the prosecuting authorities’ decisive reliance on the applicant’s statement (see paragraphs 40, 80 and 92 above) and their failure to follow some of the obvious lines of inquiry, the Court notes that it has already been recognised in the work of GRETA and other expert bodies that there may be different reasons why victims of human trafficking and different forms of sexual abuse may be reluctant to cooperate with the authorities and to disclose all the details of the case. Moreover, the possible impact of psychological trauma must be taken into account. There is thus a risk of overreliance on the victim’s testimony alone, which leads to the necessity to clarify and – if appropriate – support the victim’s statement with other evidence (see paragraphs 138, 171, 206 and 260 above).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">345.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court is of the view that the above multiple shortcomings in the conduct of the case by the prosecuting authorities fundamentally undermined the domestic authorities’ – including the relevant courts’ – ability to determine the true nature of the applicant’s and T.M.’s relationship and whether the applicant had been exploited by him as she alleged (compare </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Makaratzis v.

In fact, the criteria for an effective investigation (independence, thoroughness, promptness, public oversight and the victim’s involvement, see paragraph 305 of the judgment) should be the same across all the Articles of the Convention (for example, in the context of Article 5, in situations such as the arrest of a person of whom all traces are subsequently lost, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty</span><a name="_ftnref1" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn1" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[1]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">; and also in the context of serious violations of the rights guaranteed by Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention, such as sexual abuse</span><a name="_ftnref2" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn2" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[2]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">, insults and threats</span><a name="_ftnref3" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn3" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[3]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">, the illegal search of an apartment</span><a name="_ftnref4" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn4" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[4]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">, attacks on members of certain religious groups</span><a name="_ftnref5" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn5" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[5]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">, attacks on journalists</span><a name="_ftnref6" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn6" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[6]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A"> or protesters</span><a name="_ftnref7" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn7" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[7]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">, violence motivated by discrimination under Article 14 of the Convention</span><a name="_ftnref8" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn8" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[8]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">, and the violation of property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention</span><a name="_ftnref9" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn9" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[9]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Secondly, once there is an arguable complaint about the effectiveness of an investigation the Court is obliged to look at each of these criteria separately (even if some are not specifically addressed by the applicant in the application, the questions put at the communication stage should be broad enough to cover all the criteria), and only if all of them are fulfilled can the investigation be considered effective. As the Court has put it, none of the criteria amounts to an end in itself (see paragraph 319 of the judgment). However, only significant flaws in the fulfilment of any of these criteria, that is, flaws that are capable of undermining the investigation’s capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible, merit finding that the investigation was not effective (see paragraph 320 of the judgment). At the same time, the fact that one criterion has been fulfilled cannot offset a serious flaw or flaws in fulfilling the other criteria.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Thirdly, the Court has specified that the State has a duty under Article 4 to carry out an effective official investigation where an individual makes an “arguable complaint” of having been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 4, or, in the absence of an express complaint, where there is prima facie evidence that he or she been subjected to such treatment. The Court has further emphasised that this corresponds in essence to the Court’s approach in other cases concerning, in particular, Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 324 of the judgment), meaning that under both Articles the triggering standard for the obligation of the State to institute some form of effective investigation is the same. Consequently, the prima facie evidence to which the Court refers in this judgment (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">324, 325, 331 and 332) corresponds to the notion of “sufficiently clear indications” to which the Court commonly refers under Article 3 in this regard (see, for example, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Hassan v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> GC, no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"><a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;29750/09&quot;]}" target="_blank">29750/09</a>, §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">62, ECHR 2014; </span><span class="sA36B60A1">M.S. v.

This is reflected in the language used in paragraphs 331 and 332 of the judgment. However, that does not mean that both elements – an arguable complaint and sufficiently clear indications – must coincide in order for a duty to carry out an effective investigation to arise for a State. Either element suffices in this regard (see paragraph 324 of the judgment). This follows clearly from the obligation of the authorities to act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention (see paragraph 314 of the judgment).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Fifthly, as the authorities have to act of their own motion, the Court has emphasised that they cannot leave it to the initiative of the victim to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (ibid.). In this connection it is important to keep in mind that the Court considers that the provisions often found in contemporary domestic criminal-procedure laws, relating to the various rights of victims, are not to be understood as imposing an obligation for victims to use those rights in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Tadić v. Croatia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"><a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;10633/15&quot;]}" target="_blank">10633/15</a>, § 43, 23 November 2017).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Sixthly, it is important to note that when an investigation leads to the initiation of proceedings before the domestic courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial phase, must meet the above criteria for an effective investigation (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Öneryıldız v. Turkey </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">GC, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;48939/99&quot;]}" target="_blank">48939/99</a>, §§</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">95</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">96, ECHR 2004</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">XII; </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Ali and Ayşe Duran v.

The domestic courts must not allow the perpetrator to go unpunished. Compliance with a State’s procedural obligation under the Convention requires the domestic legal system to demonstrate its capacity and willingness to apply the criminal law against those who have unlawfully taken the life of another, violated his or her physical integrity (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Ağdaş v. Turkey</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. 34592, § 102, 27 July 2004, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">McKerr v. the United Kingdom</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;28883/95&quot;]}" target="_blank">28883/95</a>, § 134, ECHR 2001</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">‑</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">III) or grossly violated another guaranteed right of a person, for instance by exposing the person to forced labour (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Chowdury and Others</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above).

In view of the alleged violations (see paragraphs 254 and 255 of the judgment and §§ 46 and 47 of the Chamber judgment), this case presented an opportunity to elaborate further on the procedural obligations arising not only in the context of an effective investigation but in the context of an effective trial as well.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Lastly, the Court notes that in the work of GRETA and other expert bodies it has already been recognised that there may be different reasons why victims of human trafficking and of different forms of sexual abuse may be reluctant to cooperate with the authorities and to disclose all the details of the case, and it recognises the need for the domestic authorities, including the courts, to take the possible impact of the victim’s psychological trauma into account (see paragraph 344 of the judgment). In this way the Court has indicated that flaws in the protection and treatment of victims and their testimonies, and in particular disregard for their possible psychological trauma and overreliance on the victim’s testimony, are elements to be taken into consideration in reviewing the State’s procedural obligations in criminal proceedings. The Court is increasingly recognising victims’ rights in criminal proceedings as human rights, and as it has demonstrated in this case, it is ready to acknowledge the need to protect them not only under Article 8, as part of the effective respect of private life and personal integrity (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Y. v.

This was an offence, she argued, with which he could have been convicted given the available evidence. Since such a reclassification complaint, brought by an alleged victim, has difficulty finding a proper home in the Convention and its case-law, a finding of no violation would have further compounded the impunity of which the accused may have benefitted and the applicant essentially complained.</span></p><p class="sDB6E5810"><span class="sA36B60A1">1.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Problematic scope of the case</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Our first difficulty lies with the scope of the case. As demonstrated ably by judge Koskelo in her dissenting opinion at Chamber level there is a clear risk that the Grand Chamber has examined the case and sought to develop general principles with reference to facts which the applicant neither raised domestically nor relied on in her application (see §§ 2 – 10 of the dissent at Chamber level).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Applications are lodged with this Court by applicants who often act without means and without the benefit of legal representation; although this was not the applicant’s case. It is generally accepted that an applicant can clarify or elaborate upon his or her initial submission during the course of the Convention procedure (see § 219 of the Grand Chamber judgment and the authorities cited therein). It is also accepted that the Court has to treat such applications with a degree of flexibility in order for the rights guaranteed by the Convention to be practical and effective. It would be too strict, in our view, to conclude, as the dissenting Judge did at Chamber level, that the applicant raised </span><span class="sA36B60A1">no</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> issues regarding the investigation of her forced prostitution complaint or in relation to the collection of evidence. If the trial court failed to establish the constituent element of coercion, the applicant in challenging the acquittal was perhaps implicitly, but nevertheless logically, impugning the investigation which led to that result. Her main complaint was nevertheless the failure by the trial and appeal courts to convict the defendant of the lesser charge.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The principle of </span><span class="sA36B60A1">ne ultra petitum</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> means, quite literally, that a court should not go “beyond the request” or “beyond the scope of the dispute”. There is a limit to the flexibility which can be afforded one party without the procedural rights and principles which form the backbone of the Court’s own Article 6 case-law being traduced. The Grand Chamber recognises that “the applicant did not clearly articulate her complaints as regards the relevant procedural deficiencies and omissions, a circumstance which gave rise to the question regarding the scope of the case before the Court” (see §§</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">220 and 335). One may accept that the “bones” of a complaint about procedural deficiencies regarding her complaint of forced prostitution can be made out in the original application, in which she relied on Articles 3, 6, 8 and 14 and Article 1 of Protocol no. 12 of the Convention. To those bare bones the applicant subsequently added some meat in her written submissions at Chamber level.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">According to well-established case-law, the Court has jurisdiction to review the circumstances complained of in the light of the entirety of the Convention and it can view the facts presented in a different manner, requalifying under a Convention article not initially relied on. It is nevertheless limited by the facts presented by the applicants in the light of national law. The system of protection established by the Convention does not enable the Court to seize on facts that have not been adduced by the applicant and to examine those facts for compatibility with the Convention (see </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Radomilja and others v.

Nor can they be allowed to seek to further expand that scope following referral of the case to the Grand Chamber pursuant to Article 43 of the Convention. This is what has happened in the instant case.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">At domestic level, six weeks after T.M. was indicted for coerced prostitution, the applicant was identified as a potential victim of human trafficking, an administrative status taken by a multi-disciplinary domestic body. The purpose of that status was to ensure that a possibly vulnerable person receive the necessary assistance as the domestic proceedings advanced. As the Grand Chamber recognises, this does not mean that the three constituent elements of the offence of human trafficking had been made out and is independent of any duty to investigate (see § 322 of the Grand Chamber judgment). Having initially complained of the failure to investigate forced prostitution properly, or convict T.M. of the lesser offence of procuring prostitution if commission of the former offence proved impossible to establish, in her written submissions before the Chamber the applicant complained further, and for the first time, of the failure by the authorities to charge and convict T.M. of the more serious offence of human trafficking under Article 175 of the Criminal Code. This expansion of the scope of her complaint continued in her submissions before the Grand Chamber, where what was criticised was the prosecuting authorities’ erroneous characterisation of her allegations, “which undoubtedly suggested that she had been a victim of trafficking, as an issue of forced prostitution” (see § 250 of the Grand Chamber judgment).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Like the dissenting judge at Chamber level, we do not consider that the principle of </span><span class="sA36B60A1">jura novit curia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> can be allowed to operate as an invitation to applicants to alter, as a case proceeds, the factual and legal arguments on which their complaints rest. However flexibly a human rights court finds it has to operate to ensure the voices of the dispossessed and vulnerable are heard, it cannot ignore the fundamental principles of judicial procedure and must continue to operate as a court.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">It should be added that at the communication stage, by virtue of the following question – “Has there been a violation of the State’s obligations under Article 4 of the Convention </span><span class="sA36B60A1">with regard to the applicant’s allegations of human trafficking</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> [...]?” – the Chamber expanded the case to cover human trafficking, despite the absence of any such allegations by the applicant, either before the domestic investigating authorities or in her application before the Court. From then on the focus of the applicant was no longer about the failure to convict T.M. of the charge of forced prostitution or the lesser charge of procurement but rather on the failure to bring what she now argued was the correct charge, namely for the criminal offence of human trafficking. Given this alteration – whether mistaken or deliberate – of the scope of the case first by the Chamber and then by the applicant in response, the Grand Chamber should have proceeded with greater care in its legal characterisation, concentrating on the clear set of factual allegations which had been put forward by the applicant, which related (solely) to forced prostitution. It was after all these factual allegations which had been the subject of the investigation, prosecution and trial.</span></p><p class="sDB6E5810"><span class="sA36B60A1">2.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Absence of clarity in the general principles on Article 4</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The second difficulty with the case lies in the consequences for the Court’s legal analysis which seem to flow from the inflation of the scope of the case.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">As concurring judges, we do not dispute that when the applicant brought her complaint to the attention of the Croatian police, she presented an arguable claim of some treatment which could have been found to be contrary to Articles 3, 8 and even 4 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Instead of concentrating on clarifying the trigger for that positive procedural obligation and what the latter entails for domestic authorities in a case like this, the Grand Chamber judgment expends considerable space and energy exploring the concept of human trafficking. Over one hundred paragraphs of the judgment are devoted to international and EU law and practice mainly on human trafficking. Human trafficking, as the Court already clarified in previous cases, is dependent on the presence of three constituent and cumulative elements: action, means and purpose (see the elaboration of the principles in </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, no. <a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;25965/04&quot;]}" target="_blank">25965/04</a>, §§ 277-89, 7 January 2010). As the Grand Chamber judgment in the present case indicates, § 290:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“it is not possible to characterise conduct or a situation as an issue of human trafficking unless it fulfils the criteria established for that phenomenon in international law”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Having emphasised the importance of those three constituent elements, outlined existing case-law on human trafficking, while explaining that the latter can occur at national and transnational level, the judgment avoids providing a clear answer regarding whether the domestic investigating authorities should have been investigating human trafficking, forced prostitution or sexual exploitation generally. The solution to the conceptual vagueness thus developed is to refer vaguely to “treatment contrary to Article 4” (see §§ 308, 325, 328, 332 and 346) and to state that irrespective of whether the Court is (or more importantly the domestic authorities were) in the presence of human trafficking or forced prostitution, the core procedural obligation, namely the duty to investigate effectively, is the same.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The purpose of bringing a case to the Grand Chamber is to bring clarity where it is lacking and to resolve jurisprudential conflict or contradiction. By allowing the scope of the applicant’s case to be unnecessarily inflated and insisting on making this case about human trafficking the Grand Chamber has not brought clarity to its Article 4 case-law. The line between forced prostitution and human trafficking is blurred in and by this judgment. This is not helpful and was certainly not necessary, since the Court was only ever going to decide whether there had been a procedural as distinct from a substantive violation of Article 4 in the applicant’s case.</span></p><p class="sDB6E5810"><span class="sA36B60A1">3.</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">&nbsp;</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Transposition of positive procedural obligations from one Convention article to another</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Our third difficulty lies in the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">blanket</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> transposition from Articles 2 and 3 to Article 4 (and in some cases perhaps even Article 8) of the positive procedural obligations developed with reference to the former provisions (see §§ 309-11 of the Grand Chamber judgment).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The nature and scope of positive obligations under Articles 2, 3 and 4 were set out in detail in §§ 283–88 of </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, cited above. They encompass, in essence, duties to prevent, protect and punish. However, the first two positive obligations arise where the State authorities were aware or should have been aware of circumstances giving rise to a credible suspicion that an identified individual had been or was at real and immediate risk. In contrast, the procedural obligation to investigate appears to depend on something less. In </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> it was triggered “once the matter has come to the attention of the authorities” (ibid, § 288). In the present case the applicant had to make out an arguable claim and/or there had to exist prima facie evidence of “treatment contrary to Article 4” (see §§ 324-25, 331-32 and 346 of the Grand Chamber judgment).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">There is a risk that the technique of blanket transposition fails to take into account the specificity of the type of investigation which the authorities would have to initiate when confronted with an “arguable claim” or prima facie evidence under Article 2 as distinct from Articles 3 and 4, as well as the nature of the facts which would constitute such a claim under these different Convention articles. In relation to the first provision, a case like </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> provides a good example of what would generally confront the authorities in an article 2 case ([GC], no.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"><a class="appNumberLink" href="/eng#{&quot;appno&quot;:[&quot;24014/05&quot;]}" target="_blank">24014/05</a>, 14 April 2015, § 133):</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“where it is not clearly established from the outset that the death has resulted from an accident or another unintentional act, and where the hypothesis of an unlawful killing is at least arguable on the facts, the Convention requires that an investigation which satisfies the minimum threshold of effectiveness be conducted in order to shed light on the circumstances of the death”.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">In an article 2 case, to put matters bluntly, there is generally physical evidence of a death, or concrete elements pointing to the risk thereof. Similarly, in Article 3 cases, the authorities are confronted with allegations of ill-treatment, more often than not including physical manifestations on the body of the alleged victim of the treatment of which they complain. Questions may arise regarding whether the threshold of severity is reached, or the absence of physical evidence may be excused when the complainant has been under the authority and control of the State which alone was in a position to know or establish the facts complained of (see, for a recent example, </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Ibrahimov and Mammadov v. Azerbaijan</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, nos. </span><a name="File0" class="bookmark"><span class="sBB9EE52A">63571/16</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A"> and 5 others, § 89, 13 February 2020).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, in Article 4 cases, as we see from the facts of the applicant’s case, the available evidence with which investigating authorities may be confronted can be of quite a different nature. The present case involved a first connection via Facebook, social drinks, the search for employment, an alleged attempt to coerce into prostitution, continued social contact, a physical relationship carried on over months which may or may not have been consensual or which may have ceased to be consensual with time, allegations of threats and domestic violence, the renting and payment of a flat by the complainant who had been able to leave the flat on certain occasions and who retained use of her identity documents, mobile phone and part of the money earned from the alleged forced prostitution. It also involved, crucially, evidence of a friend of the complainant, with whom she had lived, confirming the threats to which she had been subject but also testifying that her involvement in prostitution had been voluntary.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the present case, it is unclear what the Court expected the police to do when confronted by the applicant’s complaint of forced prostitution. Should they, when confronted by a relatively young woman, who may have engaged in prostitution, and who appears to have been in some sort of relationship with an older, aggressive and allegedly violent man, have sought first to establish whether commission of a higher level offence like human trafficking had to be discounted, before proceeding to investigate the offence complained of, namely forced prostitution? What will an arguable claim that treatment contrary to Article 4 has taken place look like in practice and of what, in the absence of a complaint, will prima facie evidence consist? What concretely will either require of the police and subsequently the prosecution service? The reality of the applicant’s case was that the facts she presented did not appear to match the constituent elements of human trafficking, nor did some of the central pieces of evidence subsequently gathered. That does not mean that her complaint of forced prostitution was carefully and sufficiently investigated and prosecuted. The finding of a violation is the result of identified deficiencies. However, it does mean that the domestic decision not to prosecute the more serious charge of human trafficking which the applicant subsequently criticised appears to have been far from arbitrary.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">A further reason why clarity on the trigger for the procedural obligation to investigate is so important is that once triggered it becomes an own motion obligation for the domestic authorities. The authorities cannot, according to the Court’s case-law, leave it to the initiative of the alleged victim to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see § 314 of the Grand Chamber judgment). It is not incumbent on an applicant to indicate deficiencies in the collection of evidence by the domestic authorities or omissions regarding possible additional witnesses. In addition, when a complaint in relation to the procedural obligation to investigate comes before the Strasbourg court, the investigation, prosecution and judicial stages of a case all become open to examination; an examination which benefits from hindsight. As stated in § 227 of the Grand Chamber judgment:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“[...] the Court’s case-law [...] shows that it is prepared to take into account </span><span class="sA36B60A1">any particular investigative omissions it considers relevant</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> in the context of its overall assessment of an applicant’s procedural complaint of ineffective application of criminal-law mechanisms”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the present case, although the applicant’s complaint focussed on deficiencies at the judicial stage, the Court focuses instead on the investigation stage, from where it implies any subsequent prosecutorial and judicial deficiencies arise. As indicated by the dissenting judge at Chamber level, the Court must avoid, not least because it is ill-equipped, to act as a first-hand examiner and first-instance arbiter of the quality of a domestic criminal investigation. However, the transposition of Articles 2 and 3 standards to Article 4 and beyond to Article 8 carries with it just such an inherent risk. The judgment indicates that the flaws in the relevant domestic proceedings must amount to significant flaws in order to raise an issue under Article 4, emphasising that the Court is not concerned with allegations of errors or isolated omissions. However, it remains to be seen what will qualify as a “significant” flaw and the risk of the Court too easily assuming the role of a first-instance tribunal (of fact) is clear. The nature and scope of the own motion investigation obligation which an arguable claim under Article 4 or prima facie evidence of treatment contrary to that article can trigger, sits uneasily with, on the one hand, the substantial deference which the Court says it must pay to national courts in the choice of appropriate measures (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">Beganović v.

That report highlighted the fact that the level of prosecutions and convictions for human trafficking remains worryingly low, especially when compared to the number of victims identified, that although investigations in this field require a substantial body of evidence to secure a conviction, the information gathered for the report indicated that Member States are not using enough effective investigative tools and that an excessive burden is placed on victims both before and during criminal proceedings.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The picture painted in the Commission report, in the 9</span><span class="s83BE5C30 hasVerticalAlignSuper">th</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> General report published in April 2020 by GRETA, and that provided by third-party interveners in the instant case, may support a further Grand Chamber judgment like </span><span class="sA36B60A1">Rantsev</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, highlighting the scourge of human trafficking, developing the Court’s case-law and finding, where appropriate, a violation of Article 4 as a result of a failure by a respondent State to prevent, protect against and punish such crimes.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">However, while certain deficiencies in the domestic procedure involving the applicant mean it is not possible to vote against the finding of a violation of Article 4, we do not agree with the manner in which the Court decided to approach this case.

Whereas the Grand Chamber first asks the question whether “</span><span class="sA36B60A1">exploitation of prostitution ... falls within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">” (see paragraph 277 of the judgment), it ultimately finds that the protection of Article 4 covers “</span><span class="sA36B60A1">instances of serious exploitation, such as forced prostitution</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">” (see paragraph 300), and goes on to state (paragraph 301) that the “</span><span class="sA36B60A1">force</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">” in question “</span><span class="sA36B60A1">may encompass the subtle forms of coercive conduct identified in the Court’s case-law on Article 4 (see paragraphs 281-85 above), as well as by the ILO and in other international materials (see, in particular, paragraphs 141-44 above)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">”. Hence, the Grand Chamber refers us to a certain degree of gravity, to its own case-law and to international law. As regards the first requirement, it is of limited usefulness in this context, especially since the Grand Chamber does not delve into the substance of the case. It is therefore a statement of principle. As to the second requirement, none of the cases cited deals specifically with prostitution. These case-law references do not therefore appear to be very relevant. Lastly, the references to the ILO do not relate expressly to prostitution, although it is to be noted that this organisation links the issue of forced labour to the fact that the victim does not offer his or her services “voluntarily”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">3.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Grand Chamber’s response appears to me to be too ambiguous. This is evidenced, in particular, by the case-law cited in paragraphs 281 to 285 of the judgment. To date, in order to characterise forced labour, the Court has indeed required the presence of a threat, but also the absence of genuine consent. However, the latter element appears to be ultimately excluded, or at least assigned minimal importance, in the present case since the Grand Chamber concentrates on the notion of force.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">4.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Nevertheless, the time has come to address the question whether exploitation of prostitution, as such, remains compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. As a general rule, I do not believe so. Human dignity cannot be paid for. The principle that the human body is not property also remains incompatible with its commodification (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">res extra commercium</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">) and unsuited to the context of a contract of employment, which remunerates the persons concerned for their (physical or intellectual) efforts and not for making their own bodies available to others on the instructions of their employer.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">5.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Academic research shows that persons who have chosen fully and freely to engage in prostitution are in a minority. Those who do not, or no longer, wish to do so or who, in spite of themselves, have no other option, must be protected by the Convention and by the High Contracting Parties.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">6.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The harmful physical consequences and the psychological impact of prostitution are such that no one should be subjected to them without their free and informed consent. In that regard a survey was carried out in 2013 by the French National Federation of Reception and Social Integration Associations (FNARS) and the Health Monitoring Institute (IVS) on the health of persons working in prostitution who were interviewed in social and medical facilities. Of all the individuals surveyed, over half (56%) reported their state of health as fair, poor or very poor, while 35% said that they had a chronic illness (such as HIV) or psychological problems. The majority of those interviewed reported episodes of insomnia, anxiety or depression in the past year. The survey added that </span><span class="sA36B60A1">“[t]he most frequently reported kinds of violence were insults and psychological violence: 64% of respondents had been subjected to such violence at least once in the past twelve months</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">”. The survey added that </span><span class="sA36B60A1">“[o]ver a third of the respondents had been forced to have sexual relations at some point in their lives</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">”. The section dealing with respondents’ social conditions stated as follows: “</span><span class="sA36B60A1">The persons interviewed for the survey combined a number of features of social vulnerability, as evidenced by their social isolation (42% did not have a close relative or friend to call on in the event of difficulties, in particular the women) or their housing conditions (39% lived in precarious accommodation such as hotels, shelters, with friends or family, on the street, or in a squat)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">7.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">To my mind, exploitation of prostitution, in the broad sense in which it is used in paragraph 117 of the judgment, that is to say, the fact of unlawfully obtaining financial or other material benefit from the prostitution of another person, should be presumed to be contrary to Article 4 of the Convention. The sole exception should be prostitution entered into with free, informed and express consent, which cannot be characterised as forced labour. All other forms of prostitution without consent therefore come within the scope of application of Article 4.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">8.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As I see it, consent to prostitution can be considered to be free and informed if – and only if – it is expressed and obtained in an indisputable manner. No form of implicit consent can be accepted nor can it justify the exploitation of one person by another. Silence or lack of resistance must never be regarded as implicit consent. Otherwise, the way would be wide open to all manner of abuse, to say nothing of all the evidential difficulties that the victims themselves would face. Giving in is not the same as consenting (Nicole-Claude Mathieu)! Article 3 (b) of the Palermo Protocol and Rule 70 of the International Criminal Court’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence reflect this approach.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Article 3 (b) of the Palermo Protocol provides:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used”.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Rule 70 of the International Criminal Court’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence reads as follows:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">“In cases of sexual violence, the Court shall be guided by and, where appropriate, apply the following principles:</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">...</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">(b)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Consent cannot be inferred by reason of any words or conduct of a victim where the victim is incapable of giving genuine consent;</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">(c)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Consent cannot be inferred by reason of the silence of, or lack of resistance by, a victim to the alleged sexual violence;</span></p><p class="s9D48DD53"><span class="sBB9EE52A">(d)</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Credibility, character or predisposition to sexual availability of a victim or witness cannot be inferred by reason of the sexual nature of the prior or subsequent conduct of a victim or witness.”</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">9.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Hence, consent cannot be free and informed unless the person engaged in prostitution is capable of giving consent and that consent is not vitiated by, for instance, violence, error or deception. Furthermore, it must be possible for consent to be withdrawn at any time. A person cannot consent to something which he or she knows little or nothing about. Individuals engaged in prostitution may realise subsequently that this activity does not correspond in any way to how they previously imagined it, particularly where they are carrying it out in exhausting conditions, earning less than they had hoped, or in view of the devastating impact on their physical and mental health. The possibility for them to change their minds must be genuine and not merely theoretical. If prostitution is the result of a true choice then it must be possible to leave it behind at any time and without any lasting effects. Likewise, there can be no consent where there is a lack of options. Prostitution is frequently an activity of last resort. Where someone is in a situation of economic hardship, prostitution is not a genuine solution. If, and only if, all these conditions are met can we speak of a truly free choice, made voluntarily and with full awareness.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">10.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The vast majority of the Council of Europe member States criminalise involvement in the provision by another person of sexual services even where there is no coercion on the person providing the services (see paragraph 211 of the judgment). This is not necessarily a moral issue, as no one emerges unscathed from the experience of prostitution (see point 6 above). However, the Grand Chamber appears to disregard this consensus. It is true that some States regulate the exploitation of prostitution (Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland, for example). However, detailed legal regulation of an activity does not suffice to make it compatible with the Convention. The fact that it is regulated does not in any way mean that the person’s consent is entirely free, informed and express, and above all verified. I note in that connection the legislation initiated by several European countries which have opted to define sexual violence on the basis of lack of consent rather than just on the basis of violence or threats (Sweden, Iceland, the United Kingdom and Ireland, for example). Consequently, the absence of violence does not necessarily denote consent.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">11.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Lastly, Article 4 also imposes positive obligations on the High Contracting Parties. In that regard they should, at the very least, establish a legal framework that is sufficient to make the prohibition of slavery and forced labour effective; investigate thoroughly where there are credible suspicions that the rights of persons enjoying protection have been breached; and, finally, take operational steps to protect potential or actual victims. With regard to this last aspect, this would entail, firstly, strengthening the guarantees and safeguards surrounding legal prostitution, in other words, ascertaining whether the consent given is genuine. Secondly, the list of States’ positive obligations under Article 4 should be expanded by the introduction of preventive measures such as identifying and supporting persons in a precarious or vulnerable situation (the vast majority of them women) who are in danger of falling into the trap of forced prostitution, and affording assistance and protection to those who wish to escape the spiral of prostitution.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">12.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In his 1862 work Les Misérables, Victor Hugo observed as follows: </span><span class="sA36B60A1">“We say that slavery has vanished from European civilisation, but it is not true.

I will then provide a more detailed explanation of my concern as to the effect the judgment may potentially have on the scope of Article 4 § 2 of the Convention, by outlining the relationship between the two dimensions of logic (</span><span class="sA36B60A1">intension </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">) in the term “forced and compulsory labour” under the said provision.

With due respect, I consider such an undertaking unnecessary. These concepts, which in any event are not specifically mentioned in Article 4 § 2, are only instances or sub-categories of “forced or compulsory labour” and they do not cover the full breadth of the latter. As it appears from the case-law of the Court (see paragraphs 281-85 of the judgement), “forced or compulsory labour”, in general, means any work or service which is extracted from a person without his or her will by way of force (that is, using a physical or mental constraint or both) or compulsion (that is, using a menace of any penalty or a serious threat, or both).</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">5.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">I consider the approach taken in the judgment problematic for two key reasons: firstly, it disproportionately devotes the major part of its legal analysis to determining whether the treatment complained of falls within the definition of “human trafficking” and/or “exploitation of prostitution”, thus distracting from the more general issue of “forced or compulsory labour” which is at the heart of the case; and, secondly, such examination has the effect of unduly narrowing the scope of Article 4 § 2. I will briefly explain this in more detail, in order to clarify why I favour the direct methodological approach.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">6.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Firstly, as already mentioned, the major proportion of the legal analysis of the judgment is devoted to providing a definition of “human trafficking” and “exploitation of prostitution”. This may be relevant in determining whether the treatment complained of falls within the scope of Article 4 § 2, yet this should be undertaken by considering the full breadth of the concept of “forced or compulsory labour”, rather than limiting the scope of this provision to only these two sub-categories of forced or compulsory labour. The excessive focus on defining “human trafficking” and “exploitation of prostitution” diverts attention from the central and more general issue, as explained above.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">7.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Secondly, the approach taken in the judgment has the effect of limiting the scope of Article 4 § 2 by equating “forced or compulsory labour” with “human trafficking” and “exploitation of prostitution”. The methodology adopted in the judgment could lead to a situation where an authorisation, a kind of</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> “visa”, has to be requested bearing the words “human trafficking” and/or “exploitation of prostitution” in order for a complaint to be allowed to fall within Article 4 § 2.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">8.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Consequently, such methodology is: (a) erroneous, as the scope of “forced or compulsory labour” is wider and is not confined to these two sub-categories, something which the judgment seem to overlook; (b) highly restrictive; and (c) contrary to the object and purpose of Article 4 § 2, namely the practical and effective protection of the right not to be subjected to “forced or compulsory labour”, and thus in contravention of the principle of effectiveness. Again, the approach taken in the judgment is unnecessary and not in the spirit of Article 4 § 2.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">9.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">For the reasons stated above, I favour the direct methodological approach which avoids the above-mentioned problems. To my mind, the question to be asked is whether the applicant’s complaint (that is, her factual allegations) can be considered to amount to “forced or compulsory labour” within the meaning of Article 4 § 2 of the Convention. This concept is a generic and autonomous one, susceptible to evolutive interpretation, allowing the living instrument to be developed. The generic nature of the concept is reinforced by the provisions of the next paragraph of the Article, namely paragraph 3 (a)-(d), which expressly excludes from the concept of “forced or compulsory labour” four categories or kinds of work or service.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">10.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">“Human trafficking” and “exploitation of prostitution” by their very nature fall within the concept of “forced or compulsory labour”, as such behaviour is a very serious means of coercing an individual to perform labour against his or her will. “Forced or compulsory labour” may occur in many different contexts and is not limited to “human trafficking” and/or “exploitation of prostitution. The very nature of the appalling exploitation of human beings involved in “human trafficking” and/or “exploitation of prostitution” is such that it must automatically fall within the scope of Article 4 § 2.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">11.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In view of the above, the direct methodological approach obviates the need to attempt, as the judgment does, to define the concepts of “human trafficking” and/or “exploitation of prostitution”, which are very difficult concepts to define, and instead shifts the focus back to the actual and more general issue which the Court has to decide, as stated above.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">12.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">To further explain the scope of Article 4 § 2 of the Convention, I will consider the meaning of “forced or compulsory labour” in the light of its twofold dimension in logic.

In my view, like any other Convention term or concept, the scope of “forced or compulsory labour” in Article 4 § 2 of the Convention can be better understood if it is examined in the context of its twofold dimension in logic, thus in its </span><span class="sA36B60A1">intension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension</span><a name="_ftnref11" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn11" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[11]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">, as well as in the light of the relationship between these dimensions</span><a name="_ftnref12" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn12" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[12]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">14.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In logic, the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">intension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (otherwise: connotation, comprehension, definition or depth), consists of the essential qualities, properties or characteristics of a term, and </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> (otherwise: denotation, classification or breadth) consists of the matters or instances to which the term refers. An easy distinction between the two can be illustrated through the example of the term “ship”.

A deeper understanding of Convention terms is required for effective protection of human rights. This holistic approach to interpreting a Convention provision is an aspect or property of the principle of effectiveness as a norm of international law and a method of interpretation. H.E. Cunningham aptly observes that “[e]xtension and intension as applied to terms may, in a sense, apply to relations”</span><a name="_ftnref14" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn14" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[14]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">. Hence, in my view, the same applies to human rights, which are based on and concern human relations in society. Although the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">intension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> of a term is also described as a definition of the term, it should be pointed out that the concepts of relations and human rights may be very difficult to define or may sometimes even be undefinable</span><a name="_ftnref15" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn15" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[15]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">16.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Having said that, it can easily be explained why the Court prefers not to define rights, or terms concerning Convention rights. Unless it is very general, any definition of the rights would leave no room for the Convention to be developed as a living instrument, a doctrine followed by the Court. Yet, closer enquiry into the two dimensions may assist in this evolution in order to appropriately establish the meaning of the right in relation to a specific set of circumstances, while ensuring conformity with the underlying protection the Article seeks to guarantee.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">17.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">I submit that the determination of the right not to be subjected to “forced or compulsory labour” must follow this twofold meaning which the term has in logic. The </span><span class="sA36B60A1">intension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> of the term “forced or compulsory labour” is any labour which can be characterised as forced or compulsory and therefore taking place against the will of the individual. “Human trafficking” and “exploitation of prostitution” undoubtedly fall within the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">of the term, but its </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> is not limited to just these two examples. These are only some instances falling within the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> or breadth of the term “forced or compulsory labour” and, as stated above, they do not cover the full breadth of the latter.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">18.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Thus, in my humble view, if the applicant’s complaint had to be classified as “human trafficking” or “exploitation of prostitution”, in order for it to be considered “forced or compulsory labour” under Article 4 § 2,</span><span class="sD8E6486D"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">as is done by the judgment, this would unduly narrow the application of that provision.

In brief, to use the words of Horace William Brindley Joseph, “the extension and intension of words vary inversely”</span><a name="_ftnref17" class="bookmark"></a><a href="#_ftn17" class="s7ED160F0 footnote_link" target="_self"><span class="s66E9FC38 hasVerticalAlignSuper">[17]</span></a><span class="sBB9EE52A">. The less specific the definition, the more instances and objects are likely to fit within the scope of that definition. A good example given by A.

If we qualify the intension of the word “triangle” by adding the adjective “equilateral”, the intension of “triangle” increases and its extension decreases. Conversely, if we omit from the term “equilateral triangle” the adjective “equilateral”, the intension of the term decreases and its extension increases.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">21.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the present case, the meaning of “forced or compulsory labour” allows a broad array of situations and contexts to be classified as such; this requires a broad </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> and a narrow </span><span class="sA36B60A1">intension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">. However, if instead one were to identify “forced or compulsory labour” as “human trafficking” and “exploitation of prostitution”, then this would severely restrict the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension, </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">and</span><span class="sA36B60A1"> </span><span class="sBB9EE52A">consequently the term would not cover other instances of “forced or compulsory labour”. Such an interpretation would be a </span><span class="sA36B60A1">contra legem</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> since the generic term contained in Article 4 § 2 would be unjustifiably qualified. Instead, the direct methodological approach outlined above allows Article 4 § 2 to protect individuals from exploitation of labour occurring against their will.</span></p><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">22.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In my view, the consideration of these two dimensions of “forced or compulsory labour” is apt to illustrate that the direct methodological approach which I discussed above is preferable, maintaining a narrow </span><span class="sA36B60A1">intension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> and thus not erroneously limiting the </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> of the complaints that can be brought forward under Article 4 § 2. Unlike the approach taken in the judgment, the proposed direct methodological approach is compatible with the principle of effectiveness, which after all is based upon logic and fairness. This principle, both in its capacity as a norm of international law and as a method of interpretation, serves to make a term in the Convention wider, within, of course, the limits of the text and the object of the relevant Convention provision. This can be achieved either by decreasing its </span><span class="sA36B60A1">intension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A"> or increasing its </span><span class="sA36B60A1">extension</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">. By doing either, the result will be the same, namely the widening of the overall meaning of the term.</span></p><ol start="3" type="I" class="s6B505E72"><li class="sD43C993E"><span>Conclusion</span></li></ol><p class="s10950C61"><span class="sBB9EE52A">23.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the light of the above considerations, I decided to follow the direct methodological approach to dealing with the applicant’s complaint under Article 4 § 2 of the Convention.

To my mind, however, this breach was the result of failure to apply the criminal-law mechanism allowing for the investigation, prohibition and punishment of “forced or compulsory labour” in such a way as to facilitate protection using the entire breadth of this term, instead of limiting protection to the framework of “human trafficking” or “forced prostitution” as the judgment did.</span></p><p
