Furthermore, in support of their challenge to the applicant’s account of the events the Government drew attention to the inconsistencies in the evidence concerning the time of the incident and the number of village guards involved as well as to the fact that the applicant and her family failed to recognise any of the village guards although they all would have come from neighbouring villages. </span></p><p class="sFC353FA9"><span class="s29100277">B.</span><span class="s8750BF75">&nbsp;</span><span class="s3EB11201">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Treatment of the applicant during detention</span></p><p class="sAAD5D99A"><span class="sBB9EE52A">20.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant alleges that, on arrival at the gendarmerie headquarters, she was separated from her father and her sister-in-law. At some stage she was taken upstairs to a room which she later referred to as the “torture room”. There she was stripped of her clothes, put into a car tyre and spun round and round. She was beaten and sprayed with cold water from high-pressure jets. At a later stage she was taken clothed but blindfolded to an interrogation room. With the door of the room locked, an individual in military clothing forcibly removed her clothes, laid her on her back and raped her. By the time he had finished she was in severe pain and covered in blood. She was ordered to get dressed and subsequently taken to another room. According to the applicant, she was later brought back to the room where she had been raped. She was beaten for about an hour by several persons who warned her not to report on what they had done to her. </span></p><p class="s836E1A5"><span class="sBB9EE52A">21.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government have challenged the credibility of the applicant’s account of the events.

Had the applicant and the members of her family been taken into custody on that date the responsible duty officer would have followed the proper procedure and entered the details in the custody register. The station commander and the custody officer on duty at the time had been heard by the Commission delegates as witnesses and both had confirmed that no one had been taken into custody at that time.

The public prosecutor took statements from each of them. The applicant reported that she had been tortured by being beaten and raped. Her father and sister-in-law both alleged that they had been tortured. According to the applicant, she confirmed her account of what happened to her in a statement given to the Diyarbakır Human Rights Association on 15</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">July 1993, which was submitted, undated, to the Commission along with her application.</span></p><p class="sBDA4B1F0"><span class="sB90861A5">1.</span><span class="s1347D82B">&nbsp;</span><span class="sB90861A5">Medical examination of the applicant</span></p><p class="s23D77467"><span class="sBB9EE52A">24.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">All three were sent the same day to Dr Deniz Akkuş at Derik State Hospital.

According to the doctor’s report, dated the same day, defloration had occurred more than a week prior to her examination.

Dr</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Çetin did not comment on the bruising on her inner thighs on account of the fact that he was a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology.

The applicant and her husband were also repeatedly called to the police station for no apparent reason, their house had been searched (once before 19</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">October 1995 and again on 1 and 8</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">November 1995) and they were questioned about her application to the Commission.

The applicant’s husband was asked whether the police were intimidating them, to which he replied “Yes”. While they were not ill-treated on this occasion, the applicant’s husband strongly considered that they all felt intimidated by the very fact of being called by the police and that the constant calls by the police to their homes were making their situation very difficult.

By letter and comments dated 12</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">January 1996, the Government referred to the provisions of Turkish criminal procedure whereby it is the duty and unavoidable obligation of public prosecutors to investigate the facts of crimes, which involves finding and questioning witnesses. In this context, police officers function as assistants to the public prosecutors. The public prosecutor who conducted the investigation instigated by the applicant and her father, and the police officers who acted under his authority, contacted the applicant and her father with the sole purpose of investigating the facts of the allegations and assembling the evidence. They submitted that the statements taken by the public prosecutor revealed no element of pressure being exerted and it was in the interests of the applicant for further evidence to be gathered. There was, they contended, no substantiation of the allegations of intimidation and harassment, the statements submitted by the applicant’s representatives having been taken by extra-judicial means and their authenticity disputed. They submitted a letter from the Ministry of the Interior (Gendarmerie Department) stating that no search took place at the applicant’s house and that the purpose of the police officers’ visit to Seydo Aydın was to communicate to the applicant the summons to attend the Commission’s hearing. Since she was not there, he was asked for her address and there was no persecution involved. In an earlier communication of 16</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">June 1995 in response to the first allegations of harassment of the applicant’s father, the Government had responded that they rejected these allegations categorically and that they formed part of a campaign to influence the course of the proceedings and the holding of hearings to take evidence.</span></p><p class="s836E1A5"><span class="sBB9EE52A">38.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">At the taking of evidence before delegates of the Commission in Strasbourg on 18</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">October 1995, the Agent of the Government responded to allegations made orally by the applicant’s representative concerning the repeated questioning of the applicant’s father.

To avoid any problems of non-attendance or the waste of expenditure of coming to Strasbourg if she did not intend to comply with the summons, it was necessary to obtain her address from her father and that was why he was continually asked for the address.

They heard the evidence of the key witnesses, including the testimony of the applicant and her father. They were able to cross-examine the public prosecutor about the conduct of his investigation, question the doctors who had examined the applicant, probe the veracity of the account given by the two gendarmes on duty at Derik gendarmerie headquarters at the time of the events and inspect the entries in the custody register kept at the headquarters. The Commission carefully cross-checked the statements given by the applicant to the public prosecutor, to the Diyarbakır Human Rights Association and to the delegates against the various statements made by her father as well as her sister-in-law. There were inconsistencies, but they were not such as to impinge on the credibility of the applicant and of her father. There was strong, clear and concordant evidence which entitled the Commission to conclude that the applicant had in fact been detained over the relevant period and while in detention raped and ill-treated in the way described in the Commission’s report (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">40 above).</span></p><p class="sBDA4B1F0"><span class="sB90861A5">2.</span><span class="s1347D82B">&nbsp;</span><span class="sB90861A5">The applicant</span></p><p class="s7ACBD94A"><span class="sBB9EE52A">64.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant requested the Court to accept the facts as found by the Commission.

The evidence was seriously deficient as regards, firstly, the date and time of the alleged taking into custody of the Aydın family and, secondly, the alleged rape and ill-treatment of the applicant while in detention. As regards the alleged detention, none of the villagers was able to confirm her account and surprisingly no one was able to recognise any of the local village guards who were supposed to have been present at the relevant time. The applicant’s father had told the delegates at the hearing in Ankara that one of the villagers had also been detained along with his family. However he failed to name this person. The Commission had chosen to disregard the applicant’s failure to recognise photographs of Derik gendarmerie headquarters although she testified that her blindfold was removed when she was taken outside. Furthermore, the Commission had impugned without justification the credibility of the gendarmes who were on duty at the time of the alleged detention and wrongly criticised the accuracy of the custody register.</span></p><br class="s76CF415B"><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">67.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the alleged rape and ill-treatment while in detention, the Government stressed that neither Dr Akkuş nor Dr Çetin had found any bruising or injury to the applicant’s body which was consistent with rape or violent assault. The applicant maintained that she struggled during the alleged rape. However, there were no signs of bruising to her wrists or back or genitalia which would have suggested the use of violence to overcome her resistance. The bruising found on her inner thighs could be explained by factors other than the forcing apart of her legs to effect a sexual assault. In fact, the report drawn up by the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hacettepe (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">39 above), which the Government had submitted to the Commission, indicated that the bruising could have been attributed to the fact that the applicant rode a donkey. While it was true that the medical examinations confirmed that her hymen had been torn, this could not justify a conclusion that defloration had resulted from the alleged rape. It was in fact medically impossible to estimate the date of defloration after a lapse of seven days from the date of the initial tear of the hymen. Had the applicant not waited as long as she did before going to the public prosecutor the medical evidence may have yielded further results. However, her delay in so doing led to the loss of vital evidence and was fatal to any medical corroboration of her account. </span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">68.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In addition, the applicant’s claim that she was raped did not prevent her from marrying and conceiving a child shortly after the alleged event. In the view of the Government her decision to marry and her ability to be sexually active so soon after her claimed traumatic experience were scarcely consistent with the behaviour of a rape victim. It was equally surprising that, given the cultural context, her alleged loss of virginity did not create any obstacle to her marriage.</span></p><p class="s836E1A5"><span class="sBB9EE52A">69.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government accordingly requested the Court to reject the Commission’s findings together with the applicant’s allegations on account of the absence of convincing proof.</span></p><p class="sFC353FA9"><span class="s29100277">C.</span><span class="s8750BF75">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">The Court’s assessment of the evidence and the facts established by the Commission</span></p><p class="sAAD5D99A"><span class="sBB9EE52A">70.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court observes that under its constant case-law the establishment and verification of the facts are primarily a matter for the Commission (Articles</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">28 §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">1 and 31 of the Convention). While the Court is not bound by the Commission’s findings of fact and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it, it is only in exceptional circumstances that it will exercise its powers in this area (see, </span><br class="s76CF415B"><span class="sA36B60A1">inter alia</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">, the Aksoy v.

Such exceptional circumstances may arise in particular if the Court, following a careful examination of the evidence on which the Commission has based its facts, finds that those facts have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">71.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the instant case, it must be recalled that the Commission reached its findings of fact after three delegates had heard the evidence of the key witnesses in the course of hearings held in Ankara and Strasbourg. At those hearings the delegates had the advantage of putting questions to the witnesses, observing their reaction and demeanour and assessing the veracity and the probative value of their statements and overall credibility. They were also in a position to assess whether the credibility of the applicant and her father as witnesses withstood the questions put to them by the Government representatives at the hearings.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">72.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Commission reached its conclusions on the basis of the appropriate evidentiary requirement, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt. Admittedly there were inconsistencies in the testimony of the applicant and her father, as the Government have noted. However, it is to be observed that the Commission was also aware of such inconsistencies but did not consider them to be of such a fundamental nature as to undermine the credibility of the applicant’s account (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">40 above). From its own careful examination of the evidence gathered by the Commission, it would appear to the Court that there is in fact a high degree of consistency between the accounts given by the applicant, her father and sister-in-law to the public prosecutor and by the applicant and her father to the delegates, which makes it highly unlikely that the applicant’s allegations were fabricated.</span></p><p class="sA182E63D"><span class="sBB9EE52A">73.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court considers that it should accept the facts as established by the Commission, having been satisfied on the basis of the evidence which it has examined that the Commission could properly reach the conclusion that the applicant’s allegations were proved beyond reasonable doubt, it being recalled that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, pp.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">64–65, §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">161).

Referring to the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">42 and 43 above) they stressed that the public prosecutor was under a legal duty to investigate alleged offences, to gather evidence, to question witnesses and, as appropriate, to prosecute where the evidence pointed to the guilt of a suspect. As to the alleged inadequacy of the criminal investigation into the applicant’s case, they emphasised that the public prosecutor took immediate action on receipt of her complaint by sending her for a medical examination first to Dr</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Akkuş and then to a gynaecologist, Dr</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Çetin (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">24 and 25 above). Both doctors had concluded that it was impossible by that stage to date when her hymen had been torn. A third medical examination followed and the results supported this view (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">26 above). The Government insisted that the applicant’s delay in lodging a complaint with the public prosecutor had resulted in a missed opportunity to obtain medical evidence confirming or refuting the veracity of her account. In parallel to his attempts to secure medical evidence, the public prosecutor sought information from Derik gendarmerie headquarters as to whether the applicant and members of her family had been detained at the relevant time and instructed that the custody register be forwarded to him for inspection (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">27 and 28 above).</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">96.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Government stressed that the disappearance of the applicant from the Derik region impeded the investigation, including the carrying out of a psychological examination of the applicant.

The public prosecutor manifested an unacceptable degree of restraint with regard to the security forces by not questioning the gendarmes who were present at the Derik headquarters at the time of the alleged incident. Furthermore, he failed to explore other lines of enquiry which may possibly have corroborated the applicant’s account of her detention. The manner in which the medical evidence was taken and the content of the medical reports were also deficient having regard to the nature of the offence under investigation. The overall and serious inadequacy of the criminal investigation resulted in the applicant being denied effective access to a court or tribunal to have a determination of her civil right to compensation, in breach of Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">6 of the Convention.

She has sought to explain her failure even to attempt to pursue a claim for compensation on the grounds that she would have no prospect of success in the absence of proof that she had been raped and ill-treated at the hands of agents of the State, and such proof was impossible to adduce on account of the manner in which the public prosecutor conducted the investigation.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">101.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It appears to the Court that the essence of her complaint under Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">6 §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">1 of the Convention is the failure of the public prosecutor to conduct an effective investigation, which, if not giving rise to a prosecution, at the very least would prove that she had suffered harm while in custody, thus enhancing the prospects of success of her claim for compensation.</span></p><p class="s836E1A5"><span class="sBB9EE52A">102.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court considers therefore that it is appropriate to examine this complaint in relation to the general obligation on States under Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">13 to provide an effective remedy in respect of violations of the Convention. It notes in this respect that the applicant has indicated that an award of compensation would not in itself redress the gravity of the violation which she suffered, nor absolve the respondent State from respecting other aspects of its obligations under Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">3 of the Convention.</span></p><p class="sFC353FA9"><span class="s29100277">B.</span><span class="s8750BF75">&nbsp;</span><span class="s3EB11201">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">Article</span><span class="s29100277">&nbsp;</span><span class="s29100277">13 of the Convention </span></p><p class="sAAD5D99A"><span class="sBB9EE52A">103.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court recalls at the outset that Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">13 guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of this Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are </span><br class="s76CF415B"><span class="sBB9EE52A">afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the Aksoy judgment cited above, p.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">2286, §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">95).</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Furthermore, the nature of the right safeguarded under Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">3 of the Convention has implications for Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">13. Given the fundamental importance of the prohibition of torture and the especially vulnerable position of torture victims (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">81 and 83 above), Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">13 imposes, without prejudice to any other remedy available under the domestic system, an obligation on States to carry out a thorough and effective investigation of incidents of torture.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Accordingly, where an individual has an arguable claim that he or she has been tortured by agents of the State, the notion of an “effective remedy” entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure. It is true that no express provision exists in the Convention such as can be found in Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">12 of the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which imposes a duty to proceed to a “prompt and impartial” investigation whenever there is a reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">48 above). However, such a requirement is implicit in the notion of an “effective remedy” under Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">13 (see the Aksoy judgment cited above, p.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">2287, §</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">98). </span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">104.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Having regard to these principles, the Court notes that the applicant was entirely reliant on the public prosecutor and the police acting on his instructions to assemble the evidence necessary for corroborating her complaint. The public prosecutor had the legal powers to interview members of the security forces at Derik gendarmerie headquarters, summon witnesses, visit the scene of the incident, collect forensic evidence and take all other crucial steps for establishing the truth of her account. His role was critical not only to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of the offences but also to the pursuit by the applicant of other remedies to redress the harm she suffered. The ultimate effectiveness of those remedies depended on the proper discharge by the public prosecutor of his functions.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">105.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant, her father and her sister-in-law complained to the public prosecutor about the treatment they suffered while in custody. In her statement she specifically referred to the fact that she was raped and tortured at Derik gendarmerie headquarters (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">23 above). Although she may not have displayed any visible signs of torture, the public prosecutor could reasonably have been expected to appreciate the seriousness of her allegations bearing in mind also the accounts which the other members of her family gave about the treatment which they alleged they suffered. In such circumstances he should have been alert to the need to conduct promptly a thorough and effective investigation capable of establishing the truth of her complaint and leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">106.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The provisions of the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure taken together with the Criminal Code impose clear obligations on the public prosecutor to investigate allegations of torture, rape and ill-treatment (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">41–43 above). Notwithstanding, he only carried out an incomplete inquiry to determine the veracity of the applicant’s statement and to secure the prosecution and conviction of the culprits. While he may not have been provided with the names of villagers who may have seen the Aydın family being taken into custody on 29</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">June 1993, he could have been expected to take steps of his own initiative to ascertain possible eyewitnesses. It would appear that he did not even visit Tasit to familiarise himself with the scene of the incident which occurred on that date and whether the locations were consistent with those mentioned by the applicant or the other members of the family in their statements. Furthermore, he took no meaningful measures to determine whether the Aydın family were held at Derik gendarmerie headquarters as alleged. No officers were questioned in the critical initial stages of the investigation. The public prosecutor was content to conduct this part of the inquiry by correspondence with officials at the headquarters (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">27 and 28 above). He accepted too readily their denial that the Aydın family had been detained and was prepared to accept at face value the reliability of the entries in the custody register. Had he been more diligent, he would have been led to explore further the reasons for the low level of entries for the year 1993 given the security situation in the region (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">27 and</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">28 above). His failure to look for corroborating evidence at the headquarters and his deferential attitude to the members of the security forces must be considered to be a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">107.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It would appear that his primary concern in ordering three medical examinations in rapid succession was to establish whether the applicant had lost her virginity. The focus of the examinations should really have been on whether the applicant was a rape victim, which was the very essence of her complaint. In this respect it is to be noted that neither Dr</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Akkuş nor Dr</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">Çetin had any particular experience of dealing with rape victims (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">24 and 25 above). No reference is made in either of the rather summary reports drawn up by these doctors as to whether the applicant was asked to explain what had happened to her or to account for the bruising on her thighs. Neither doctor volunteered an opinion on whether the bruising was consistent with an allegation of involuntary sexual intercourse (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">24 and 25 above). Further, no attempt was made to evaluate, psychologically, whether her attitude and behaviour conformed to those of a rape victim.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court notes that the requirement of a thorough and effective investigation into an allegation of rape in custody at the hands of a State official also implies that the victim be examined, with all appropriate sensitivity, by medical professionals with particular competence in this area and whose independence is not circumscribed by instructions given by the prosecuting authority as to the scope of the examination. It cannot be concluded that the medical examinations ordered by the public prosecutor fulfilled this requirement.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">108.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">It has been contended that the investigation is still being conducted and that the applicant’s absence from the vicinity of Derik impeded the investigation for a certain period (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">96 above). She has also refused to undergo a further examination involving psychological testing (see paragraph</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">96 above). In the view of the Court, this cannot justify the serious defects and inertia which characterised the crucial phase immediately following receipt of the complaint. The public prosecutor had at that stage the legal means to act promptly and gather all necessary evidence including, as appropriate, psychological and behavioural evidence; nor can the decision to suspend the investigation on account of the applicant’s absence be justified given the gravity of the offence under investigation.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">109.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">In the light of the above considerations, it must be concluded that no thorough and effective investigation was conducted into the applicant’s allegations and that this failure undermined the effectiveness of any other remedies which may have existed given the centrality of the public prosecutor’s role to the system of remedies as a whole, including the pursuit of compensation.</span></p><p class="s836E1A5"><span class="sBB9EE52A">In conclusion, there has been a violation of Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">13 of the Convention. </span></p><p class="sAE5BCF31"><span class="s3CA22BA">IV.</span><span class="sF70C4A40">&nbsp;</span><span class="s3CA22BA">ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 25 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION</span></p><p class="sC2354B74"><span class="sBB9EE52A">110.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The applicant complained that the authorities had harassed and intimidated both her and members of her family in various ways on account of her decision to bring proceedings before the Convention institutions.

After leaving her village, her father was constantly questioned about her whereabouts. Her own home had been searched on two occasions and her husband had been twice taken into custody and beaten by police officers. She further alleged that neighbours had reported that the security forces had stoned her father-in-law’s house. In November 1996, following the publication of the Commission’s report and while the hearing in her case was pending before the Court, the authorities tried to pressurise her into undergoing a fourth medical examination in Istanbul, threatening to take her there by force if she refused (see paragraphs</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">7 and 8 above).

The Government in fact had rejected these allegations in a letter sent to the Commission on 12</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">December 1995 in response to the Commission’s request for an official reaction to them and they stood by that official denial. They recalled that under the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure the public prosecutor together with the police were and continue to be under an obligation to conduct an investigation into the complaint which the applicant herself had made. The fact that the applicant had invoked the Convention system to seek redress in respect of her allegations did not bring an end to the investigation at the domestic level. It was of crucial importance to the success of that investigation to interview the applicant and her father about the events which they alleged took place and to check the veracity of their account. No pressure was ever exerted on the applicant and her family. In fact the authorities had endeavoured to facilitate her appearance before the delegates in Strasbourg in October 1995 both by trying to contact her through her father about the impending hearing and by expediting the issue of a passport.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">113.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">As to the applicant’s allegation that the authorities had tried to pressurise her in November 1996 into undergoing a fourth medical examination in Istanbul, the Government once again highlighted the need to further the criminal investigation into her rape allegation by submitting her to a psychological examination. She was under no obligation to submit to any such examination and indeed the authorities have respected her wish not to be examined.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">114.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Commission found that the applicant and her family were genuinely complaining of harassment and intimidation and had been subjected to significant pressure in circumstances which threatened to impinge on her continued participation in the proceedings before it and that this had rendered the exercise of her right of individual petition more difficult. While it was true that there was no independent evidence to support the allegations, the Commission considered nevertheless that the Government had on no occasion provided any plausible reasons which could justify the contacts which the authorities had with the applicant and her family. Furthermore, although invited by the Commission to address the factual allegations of intimidation and harassment, the Government had failed to do so.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">115.</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">The Court stresses that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted by Article</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">25 of the Convention that applicants or potential applicants are able to communicate freely with the Commission without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see the Akdivar and Others v.

However, before the Court the Government reaffirmed that the allegations of intimidation and harassment had not been substantiated.

Liability in law does not stem only from the principle of fault or the theory of negligence in the performance of public duties; the authorities can be held strictly liable. As a rule, the authorities are liable in damages where a causal link can be established as a direct result of the acts of the public servant. However, as an exception to this rule, the authorities must pay compensation – irrespective of any causal link – for damage connected with its field of activity which it has been unable to prevent despite its responsibility for so doing. This principle, which is based on the concept of collective liability and is known as the “social risk” principle, is recognised in the case-law and legal opinion.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">It is a well-known fact that terrorist acts, particularly in one part of the country, are directed against the State, the aim being the overthrow of the constitutional order of the State; they do not stem from personal hostility towards the victims, whether individuals or institutions.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Persons who sustain damages as a result of such actions and who have not been involved in any way in acts of terrorism are victims not of their own fault or actions but of the social unrest our society is going through. In short, they sustain damage because they are members of that society. Compensation for the damage must thus be paid according to the principle of social risk by the authorities who, though responsible for preventing terrorist activity, proved incapable of doing so. In fact the authorities’ association of society in the payment of compensation for damage thus sustained is both just and in accordance with the principle of the social State. </span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">The facts of the case show that the damage sustained by the plaintiffs was not the result of their own actions but of their role as members of a State whose territorial integrity is threatened by large-scale terrorist activity. Consequently, even though no fault can be imputed to the authorities in the incident, they must compensate any extraordinary damage sustained by individuals in areas where a state of emergency has been declared.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Consequently, even though loss of financial support is a hypothetical concept, it will be necessary to take into account in the

He was killed at the wheel of his vehicle by warning shots when he failed to heed their orders. The case was referred to the district administrative council, which decided that the gendarmes responsible for Sabri Kaya’s death should be put on trial. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court but was then set aside by the Third Diyarbakır Assize Court, which held that the accused should be acquitted. The plaintiffs referred the present case to this Court and claimed non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the death of the head of their family and pecuniary damage arising out of the loss of his support.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">In accordance with an expert opinion obtained by this Court, it is held that total compensation of TRL 42,098,574 shall be paid for pecuniary damage, made up of TRL 14</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">million to the deceased’s widow, Sabriye Kara, TRL 8</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">million to Kutbettin, TRL 6</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">million to Cebelli, TRL</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">5</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">million to Mahmut, TRL 4</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">million to Ramazan and TRL 3</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">&nbsp;</span><span class="sBB9EE52A">million to Gülistan, the deceased’s children.</span></p><p class="s2637CC02"><span class="sBB9EE52A">Further, taking into consideration the pattern of the modern family formed of father, mother and children, it is obvious that loss of one of the members of the family produces negative effects from a pecuniary and non-pecuniary standpoint for the rest of the family. In this respect, payment of compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained by members of the family amounts to a measure aimed at family protection.

The majority appear to criticise the public prosecutor in that “his primary concern” in ordering the medical examinations in July 1993 was to “establish whether the applicant had lost her virginity”, whereas the “very essence” of her complaint was that she was a rape victim (see paragraph 107 of the judgment). It is difficult to see how this distinction can be of particular relevance in the circumstances of the case. Furthermore, it has to be observed that the documents sent by the public prosecutor to the doctors were not produced to the Court and that the applicant complained in her statement of 8 July 1993 to the public prosecutor that she had been “raped” and indeed also that her “virginity” had been “destroyed” (AM Appendix 2).</span></p></div><div id="_ftn30"><p class="sA1D3DA2E"><span class="sBB9EE52A">1.
